And what determines how an econ\nomy’s capacity to produce goods and services changes over time? To answer\nthese questions, we must understand macroeconomics, the branch of economics that studies how economies’ overall levels of employment, production, and\ngrowth are determined. \n\nMacroeconomic analysis emphasizes four aspects of economic life that, until\nnow, we have usually kept in the background to simplify our discussion of international economics:\n\n1. Unemployment: We know that in the real world, workers may be unemployed\nand factories may be idle. Macroeconomics studies the factors that cause\nunemployment and the steps governments can take to prevent it.\n\n2. Saving: In earlier chapters, we usually assumed that every country consumes an\namount exactly equal to its income—no more and no less. In reality, though,\nhouseholds can put aside part of their income to provide for the future, or they can\nborrow temporarily to spend more than they earn.\n\n3. Trade imbalances: As we saw in earlier chapters, the value of a country’s\nimports equals the value of its exports when spending equals income. This\nstate of balanced trade is seldom attained by actual economies.\n\n4. Money and the price level: The trade theory you have studied so far is a barter\ntheory, one in which goods are exchanged directly for other goods on the\nbasis of their relative prices. In practice, it is more convenient to use money—a\nwidely acceptable medium of exchange—in transactions, and to quote prices\nin terms of money. Because money changes hands in virtually every transaction\nthat takes place in a modern economy, fluctuations in the supply of money\nor in the demand for it can affect both output and employment."},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"lecture_10.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.165","bibliography":["references.bib"],"editor":"visual","theme":"cosmo"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}},"pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"xelatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","output-file":"lecture_10.pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"block-headings":true,"bibliography":["references.bib"],"editor":"visual","documentclass":"scrreprt"},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}
