The difference between exports of goods and services and imports of goods and services is known as the current account balance (or current account).\n\n-   If we denote the current account by CA, we can express this definition in symbols as:\n\n$$CA = EX - IM$$\n\n-   When a country's imports exceed its exports, we say the country has a *current account deficit*.\n\n-   A country has a *current account surplus* when its exports exceed its imports.\n\n-   The current account is important because it measures the size and direction of international borrowing. When a country imports more than it exports, it is buying more from foreigners than it sells to them and must somehow finance this current account deficit.\n\n### How does country pay for additional imports once it has spent its export earnings?\n\n-   The country as a whole can import more than it exports only if it can borrow the difference from foreigners.\n\n-   A country with a current account deficit must be increasing its net foreign debts by the amount of the deficit.\n\nExample: This is currently the position of the United States, which has a significant current account deficit.\n\n-   A country with a current account surplus is earning more from its exports than it spends on imports. This country finances the current account deficit of its trading partners by lending to them.\n\n-   We have defined the current account as the difference between exports and import . The current account is also equal to the difference between national income and domestic residents' total spending C + I + G:\n\n$$CA = EX-IM$$ $$Y - (C + I + G) = CA$$\n\n## Saving and the Current Account\n\nIn a closed economy, national saving always equals investment.\n\nLet S stand for national saving. Our definition of S tells us that $$S = I$$\n\nSince the closed-economy GNP identity, $$Y = C + I + G$$,\n\nmay also be written as $$I = Y - C - G$$\n\nWhereas in a closed economy, saving and investment must always be equal, in an open economy they can differ. $$CA = EX - IM$$\n\nwe can rewrite the GNP identity as $$S = I + CA$$\n\nUnlike a closed economy, an open economy with profitable investment opportunities does not have to increase its saving in order to exploit them.\n\nBecause one country's savings can be borrowed by a second country in order to increase the second country's stock of capital, a country's current account surplus is often referred to as its net foreign investment. Of course, when one country lends to another to finance investment, part of the income generated by the investment in future years must be used to pay back the lender. Domestic investment and foreign investment are two different ways in which a country can use current savings to increase its future income.\n\n## The Balance of Payments Accounts\n\nA country's balance of payments accounts keep track of both its payments to and its receipts from foreigners. Any transaction resulting in a receipt from foreigners is entered in the balance of payments accounts as a credit. Any transaction resulting in a payment to foreigners is entered as a debit. Three types of international transaction are recorded in the balance of payments:\n\n1.  Transactions that arise from the export or import of goods or services and therefore enter directly into the current account.\n\n2.  Transactions that arise from the purchase or sale of financial assets. An asset is any one of the forms in which wealth can be held, such as money, stocks, factories, or government debt. The financial account of the balance of payments records all international purchases or sales of financial assets.\n\n3.  Certain other activities resulting in transfers of wealth between countries are recorded in the capital account. For example, if the U.S. government forgives USD 1 billion in debt owed to it by the government of Pakistan, U.S. wealth declines by USD 1 billion and a USD 1 billion debit is recorded in the U.S. capital account.\n\n## The Fundamental Balance of Payments Identity\n\nBecause any international transaction automatically gives rise to offsetting credit and debit entries in the balance of payments, the sum of the current account balance and the capital account balance automatically equals the financial account balance:\n\n$$Currentaccount + Capitalaccount = Financialaccount$$\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"lecture_11.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.475","bibliography":["international_trade_finance.bib"],"editor":"visual","theme":"cosmo"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}},"pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"xelatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","output-file":"lecture_11.pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"block-headings":true,"bibliography":["international_trade_finance.bib"],"editor":"visual","documentclass":"scrreprt"},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}
