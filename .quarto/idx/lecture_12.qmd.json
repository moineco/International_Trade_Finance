As with many other modern conveniences, we take money for granted until something goes wrong with it! In fact, the easiest way to appreciate the importance of money is to imagine what economic life would be like without it.\n\n### Money as a Medium of Exchange\n\n-   The most important function of money is to serve as a medium of exchange, a generally accepted means of payment. To see why a medium of exchange is necessary, imagine how time-consuming it would be for people to purchase goods and services in a world where the only type of trade possible is barter trade---the direct trade of goods or services for other goods or services.\n\n-   Money eliminates the enormous search costs connected with a barter system because money is universally acceptable.\n\n-   A complex modern economy would cease functioning without some standardized and convenient means of payment.\n\n### Money as a Unit of Account\n\n-   Money's second important role is as a unit of account, that is, as a widely recognized measure of value.\n\n-   Prices of goods, services, and assets are typically expressed in terms of money. Exchange rates allow us to translate different countries' money prices into comparable terms.\n\n-   The convention of quoting prices in money terms simplifies economic calculations by making it easy to compare the prices of different commodities.\n\n### Money as a Store of Value\n\n-   Because money can be used to transfer purchasing power from the present into the future, it is also an asset, or a store of value. This attribute is essential for any medium of exchange because no one would be willing to accept it in payment if its value in terms of goods and services evaporated immediately.\n\n-   Money's usefulness as a medium of exchange, however, automatically makes it the most liquid of all assets.vSince money is readily acceptable as a means of payment, money sets the standard against which the liquidity of other assets is judged.\n\n### How the Money Supply Is Determined\n\n-   An economy's money supply is controlled by its central bank. The central bank directly regulates the amount of currency in existence and also has indirect control over the amount of checking deposits issued by private banks.\n\n### Money Demand\n\n-   How individual households and firms determine their demands for money? Three main factors determine aggregate money demand:\n\n1.  The interest rate: A rise in the interest rate causes each individual in the economy to reduce her demand for money.\n\n2.  The price level: The economy's price level is the price of a broad reference basket of goods and services in terms of currency. Generally, the reference basket includes standard, everyday consumption items such as food, clothing, and housing and less routine purchases such as medical care and legal fees. If the price level rises, individual households and firms must spend more money than before to purchase their usual weekly baskets of goods and services. To maintain the same level of liquidity as before the price level increase, they will therefore have to hold more money.\n\n3.  Real national income: When real national income (GNP) rises, more goods and services are sold in the economy. This increase in the real value of transactions raises the demand for money, given the price level.\n\n## Exchange Rates and International Transactions\n\nThe price of one currency in terms of another is called an exchange rate Changes in exchange rates are described as depreciations or appreciations. All else equal, a depreciation of a country's currency makes its goods cheaper for foreigners. All else equal, an appreciation of a country's currency makes its goods more expensive for foreigners.\n\n### The Foreign Exchange Market\n\nThe market in which international currency trades take place is called the foreign exchange market.\n\n#### The Actors\n\nThe major participants in the foreign exchange market are commercial banks, corporations that engage in international trade, non-bank financial institutions such as asset management firms and insurance companies, and central banks.\n\nI now describe the major actors in the market and their roles.\n\n1.  Commercial banks: Commercial banks are at the center of the foreign exchange market because almost every sizable international transaction involves the debiting and crediting of accounts at commercial banks in various financial centers. Thus, the vast majority of foreign exchange transactions involve the exchange of bank deposits denominated in different currencies.\n\n2.  Corporations: Corporations with operations in several countries frequently make or receive payments in currencies other than that of the country in which they are headquartered. To pay workers at a plant in Mexico, for example, IBM may need Mexican pesos. If IBM has only dollars earned by selling computers in the United States, it can acquire the pesos it needs by buying them with its dollars in the foreign exchange market.\n\n3.  Non-bank financial institutions: Over the years, deregulation of financial markets in the United States, Japan, and other countries has encouraged non-bank financial institutions such as mutual funds to offer their customers a broader range of services, many of them indistinguishable from those offered by banks. Among these have been services involving foreign exchange transactions. Institutional investors such as pension funds often trade foreign currencies. So do insurance companies. Hedge funds, which cater to very wealthy individuals and are not bound by the government regulations that limit mutual funds' trading strategies, trade actively in the foreign exchange market.\n\n4.  Central banks: In the last chapter, we learned that central banks sometimes intervene in foreign exchange markets. While the volume of central bank transactions is typically not large, the impact of these transactions may be great. The reason for this impact is that participants in the foreign exchange market watch central bank actions closely for clues about future macroeconomic policies that may affect exchange rates. Government agencies other than central banks may also trade in the foreign exchange market, but central banks are the most regular official participants.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"format-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"lecture_12.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
