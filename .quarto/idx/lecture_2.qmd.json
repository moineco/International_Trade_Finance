Climate and resources clearly explain why Brazil exports coffee and Saudi Arabia exports oil. \n\n- Why does Japan export automobiles, while the United States exports aircraft?\n\n-  There are various different models that try to explain the reason behind the pattern of trade.\n\n> \"Who sells what to whom\" have been a major question of international economics.\n\n## Determinents of trade\n\n- After World War II the advanced democracies, led by the United States, pursued a broad policy of removing barriers to international trade; this policy reflected the view that free trade was a force not only for prosperity but also for promoting world peace.\n\n- In 2016, Britain shocked the political establishment by voting to leave the European Union, which guarantees free movement of goods and people among its members.\n\n> Conflicts of interest within nations are usually more important in determining trade policy than conflicts of interest between nations. \n\n## Balance of payments\n\n- The balance of payments (BOP) tracks international transactions. When funds go into a country, a credit is added to the balance of payments (“BOP”). When funds leave a country, a deduction is made.\n\n- The balance of payments includes both the current account and capital/financial account.\n    \n    - The current account (CA) includes a nation's net trade in goods and services, its net earnings on cross-border investments, and its net transfer payments.\n    \n    - The capital/financial account (FA) consists of a nation's transactions in financial instruments and central bank reserves.\n    \n    - The sum of all transactions recorded in the balance of payments should be zero; however, exchange rate fluctuations and differences in accounting practices may hinder this in practice.\n    \n> The BOP has become a central issue for the United States because the nation has run huge trade deficits every year since 1982.\n\n## What is trade?\n\n-   Buying and selling goods and services from other countries. Trade consist of imports (M) and exports (X). For instance, in the context of Japan:\n\n    -   The purchase of goods and services from abroad that leads to an outflow of currency from Japan -- Imports (M)\n    -   The sale of goods and services to buyers from other countries leading to an inflow of currency to Japan -- Exports (X)\n\n## Basic reasons behind trade?\n\n-   Countries engage in international trade for two basic reasons\n    -   They are different from each other in terms of climate, land, capital, labor, and technology.\n    -   They try to achieve scale economies in production.\n\n## The concept of comparative advantage\n\n-   On Valentine's Day the U.S. demand for roses is about 10 million roses.\n\n    -   Growing roses in the U.S. in the winter is difficult. Heated greenhouses should be used. The costs for energy, capital, and labor are substantial.\n\n    -   Resources for the production of roses could be used to produce other goods, say computers.\n\n## Opportunity cost\n\n-   The opportunity cost of roses in terms of computers is the number of computers that could be produced with the same resources as a given number of roses.\n\n## Comparative advantage\n\n-   A country has a comparative advantage in producing a good if the opportunity cost of producing that good in terms of other goods is lower in that country than it is in other countries.\n\n## Gains from trade due to comparative advantage\n\n-   Suppose that in the U.S., 10 million roses can be produced with the same resources as 100,000 computers.\n\n-   Suppose also that in Mexico, 10 million roses can be produced with the same resources as 30,000 computers.\n\n    |        | Millon roses | Thousand computers |\n    |--------|--------------|--------------------|\n    | U.S    | -10          | +100               |\n    | Mexico | +10          | -30                |\n    | Total  | 0            | +70                |\n\n## Globalization and international trade\n\n-   Globalization is the process of interaction and integration among people, companies, and governments worldwide.\n\n-   Globalization has accelerated since the 18th century due to advances in transportation and communications technology.\n\n-   This increase in global interactions has caused a growth in international trade.\n\n## The gravity model\n\n- Let’s begin by describing who trades with whom. An empirical relationship known as the gravity model helps to make sense of the value of trade between any pair of countries and sheds light on the impediments that continue to limit international trade even in today’s global economy.\n\n- Three of the top 15 U.S. trading partners are European nations: Germany, the United Kingdom, and France. Why does the United States trade more heavily with these three European countries than with others? The answer is that these are the three largest European economies. That is, they have the highest values of gross domestic product (GDP), which measures the total value of all goods and services produced in an economy. \n\n> There is a strong empirical relationship between the size of a country’s economy and the volume of both its imports and its exports.\n\n## The increasing returns\n\n-   Nobel Prize Lecture, by Paul Krugman\n\n    -   Increasing returns and trade\n\n    -   Geography ignored\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"lecture_2.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.165","bibliography":["references.bib"],"editor":"visual","theme":"cosmo"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}},"pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"xelatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","output-file":"lecture_2.pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"block-headings":true,"bibliography":["references.bib"],"editor":"visual","documentclass":"scrreprt"},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}
