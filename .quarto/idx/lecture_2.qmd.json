Climate and resources clearly explain why Brazil exports coffee and Saudi Arabia exports oil.\n\n-   Why does Japan export automobiles, while the United States exports aircraft?\n\n-   There are various different models that try to explain the reason behind the pattern of trade.\n\n> \"Who sells what to whom\" have been a major question of international economics.\n\n## Determinents of trade\n\n-   After World War II the advanced democracies, led by the United States, pursued a broad policy of removing barriers to international trade; this policy reflected the view that free trade was a force not only for prosperity but also for promoting world peace.\n\n-   In 2016, Britain shocked the political establishment by voting to leave the European Union, which guarantees free movement of goods and people among its members.\n\n> Conflicts of interest within nations are usually more important in determining trade policy than conflicts of interest between nations.\n\n## Balance of payments\n\n-   The balance of payments (BOP) tracks international transactions. When funds go into a country, a credit is added to the balance of payments (\"BOP\"). When funds leave a country, a deduction is made.\n\n-   The balance of payments includes both the current account and capital/financial account.\n\n    -   The current account (CA) includes a nation's net trade in goods and services, its net earnings on cross-border investments, and its net transfer payments.\n\n    -   The capital/financial account (FA) consists of a nation's transactions in financial instruments and central bank reserves.\n\n    -   The sum of all transactions recorded in the balance of payments should be zero; however, exchange rate fluctuations and differences in accounting practices may hinder this in practice.\n\n> The BOP has become a central issue for the United States because the nation has run huge trade deficits every year since 1982.\n\n## What is trade?\n\n-   Buying and selling goods and services from other countries. Trade consist of imports (M) and exports (X). For instance, in the context of Japan:\n\n    -   The purchase of goods and services from abroad that leads to an outflow of currency from Japan -- Imports (M)\n    -   The sale of goods and services to buyers from other countries leading to an inflow of currency to Japan -- Exports (X)\n\n## Labor Intensive and capital intensive industries\n\n### What Is labor intensive?\n\n-   The term labor intensive refers to a process or industry that requires a large amount of labor to produce its goods or services.\n\n-   The degree of labor intensity is typically measured in proportion to the amount of capital required to produce the goods or services: the higher the proportion of labor costs required, the more labor-intensive the business.\n\n-   Labor-intensive industries include restaurants, hotels, agriculture, mining, as well as healthcare and caregiver.\n\n-   Less developed economies, as a whole, tend to be more labor-intensive. This situation is rather common because low income means that the economy or business cannot afford to invest in expensive capital.\n\n-   Before the industrial revolution, 90% of the workforce was employed in agriculture. Producing food was very labor-intensive.\n\n### What is capital intensive?\n\n-   Capital intensive refers to the production that requires higher capital investment such as financial resources, sophisticated machinery, more automated machines, the latest equipment, etc.\n\n-   Capital intensive industries pose higher barriers to entry as they require more investment in equipment and machinery to produce goods and services.\n\n-   Good examples of capital intensive industries include the oil refining industry, telecommunications industry, airline industry, and public transport authorities that maintain the roads, railways, trains, trams, etc.\n\n### Differences between capital intensive and labor intensive industries\n\n-   Capital intensive and labor intensive refer to types of production methods followed in the production of goods and services.\n\n-   Capital intensive production requires more equipment and machinery to produce goods; therefore, require a larger financial investment.\n\n-   Labor intensive refers to production that requires a higher labor input to carry out production activities in comparison to the amount of capital required.\n\n\n**Reference:** Chapter 1- Introduction (Paul Krugman, Maurice Obstfeld, and Marc Melitz, *International Economics*, 12th edition)\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"lecture_2.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.165","bibliography":["references.bib"],"editor":"visual","theme":"cosmo"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}},"pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"xelatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","output-file":"lecture_2.pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"block-headings":true,"bibliography":["references.bib"],"editor":"visual","documentclass":"scrreprt"},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}
