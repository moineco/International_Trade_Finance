For instance, the opportunity cost of watching movey is the hour of studying she gives up to do that                                                    |\n| Growth\t                       | An increase in an economy's ability to produce goods and services over time; economic growth in the PPF model is illustrated by a shift out of the PPF                                                                   |\n| Contraction                  | A dcrease in output that occurs due to the under-utilization of resources. In a graphical model of the PPF, a contraction is represented by moving to a point that is further away from, and on the interior of the PPF  |\n| Constant opportunity costs   | when the opportunity cost of a good remains constant as output of the good increases, which is represented as a PPF curve that is a straight line                                                                        |\n| Increasing opportunity costs\t | when the opportunity cost of a good increases as output of the good increases, which is represented in a graph as a PPF that is bowed out from the origin                                                                |\n| Productivity                 | (also called technology) the ability to combine economic resources; an increase in productivity causes economic growth even if economic resources have not changed, which would be represented by a shift out of the PPF |\n\n## Heckscher--Ohlin model of trade\n\n-   We now go one step further and explain the reason, or cause, for the difference in relative commodity prices and comparative advantage between the two nations.\n\n-   Questions were left largely unanswered by Ricardo. According to Ricardo, comparative advantage was based on the difference in the productivity of labor among nations, but he provided no explanation for such a difference in productivity, except for possible differences in clima.te\n\n-   Named after two Swedish economists, Eli Heckscher and Bertil Ohlin, the Heckscher--Ohlin model studies the pattern of production and trade that arises when countries have diﬀerent endowments of factors of production, such as labor, capital and land.\n\n-   The Heckscher--Ohlin model of trade states that endowment diﬀerences among countries play a key role in determining the pattern of trade.\n\n> Heckscher--Ohlin Theorem. A country has a comparative advantage in the good that is relatively intensive in the country's relatively abundant factor.\n\n## The Krugman model of trade\n\n-   The Krugman model or the model of trade based on internal economies of scale in production.\n\n-   It shows how countries can gain from trade even in a world where countries have identical endowments and technologies, provided that production functions exhibit increasing returns to scale and consumers have a love for variety.\n\n## The gravity model\n\n-   Let's begin by describing who trades with whom. An empirical relationship known as the gravity model helps to make sense of the value of trade between any pair of countries and sheds light on the impediments that continue to limit international trade even in today's global economy.\n\n-   Three of the top 15 U.S. trading partners are European nations: Germany, the United Kingdom, and France. Why does the United States trade more heavily with these three European countries than with others? The answer is that these are the three largest European economies. That is, they have the highest values of gross domestic product (GDP), which measures the total value of all goods and services produced in an economy.\n\n> There is a strong empirical relationship between the size of a country's economy and the volume of both its imports and its exports.\n\n-   The basic form of the gravity equation is as follows:\n\n$$T_{ij} = \\frac{GDP_{i}^{\\alpha } GDP_{j}^{\\beta}}{D_{ij}^{\\theta}}$$ Here,\n\n$T_{ij}$ indicates bilateral trade between country $i$, and $j$\n\n$GDP_i$ indicates the economic size of $i$, measured by gross domestic product\n\n$D_{ij}$ indicates the bilateral distance between the two countries\n\nThe parameters are $α$, $β$, and $θ$\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"lecture_5.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.165","bibliography":["references.bib"],"editor":"visual","theme":"cosmo"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}},"pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"xelatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","output-file":"lecture_5.pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"block-headings":true,"bibliography":["references.bib"],"editor":"visual","documentclass":"scrreprt"},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}
