{"title":"The Political Economy of Trade Policy","markdown":{"headingText":"The Political Economy of Trade Policy","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nPrevious lectures have answered the question, “Why do nations trade?” by\ndescribing the causes and effects of international trade and the functioning of\na trading world economy. This lecture examines the policies that governments adopt toward international\ntrade, policies that involve a number of different actions. These actions include:\n\n- Taxes \n\n- Subsidies \n\n- Legal limits on the value or volume of particular imports\n\n- Other measures\n\nThe chapter thus provides a framework for understanding the effects of the most\nimportant instruments of trade policy.\n\n\n## Basic Tariff Analysis\n\nA tariff is a tax levied when a good is imported. There are various types of tariff. \n\n- *Specific tariff* are levied as a fixed charge for each unit of goods imported (for example, $3 per barrel of oil).\n\n- *Ad valorem* tariffs are taxes that are levied as a fraction of the value of\nthe imported goods (for example, a 25 percent U.S. tariff on imported trucks).\n\nTariffs are the oldest form of trade policy and have traditionally been used as a source\nof government income. Their true purpose is to provide revenue and to protect particular domestic sectors.\n\nThe importance of tariffs has declined in modern times because modern governments usually prefer to protect domestic industries\nthrough a variety of non-tariff barriers, such as: \n\n- Import quotas (limitations on the quantity of imports) \n\n- Export restraints (limitations on the quantity of exports—usually imposed by the exporting country at the importing country’s request). \n\nNonetheless, an understanding of the effects of a tariff remains vital for understanding other trade policies.\n\n## Political economy and trade policy\n\nIn 2008, several developing countries were forced to reduce crop prices domestically. To increase domestic supply for food products, countries like Thailand,\nRussia, and Ukraine chose to restrict food exports. Such a trade policy was not only\npolitically improper, as it serves only one country’s interest, but also economically\ncounter-productive. For example, farmers in Ukraine dumped around €90 million worth of grain as they harvested more than they could supply domestically,\ndue to the export restrictions, while the world supply was insufficient.\n\nBanning exports may have reduced domestic prices, but importers had to look elsewhere\nfor sources of supply, creating a rise in global crop prices. Thus, such policies\nproduce more costs than benefits as higher the price, the greater the incentive to\nhoard, which create shifts in prices. Clearly, government policies reflect intentions\nthat go beyond simple measures of cost and benefit.\n\n### Free Trade and Efficiency\n\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"lecture_6.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.165","bibliography":["references.bib"],"editor":"visual","theme":"cosmo"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}},"pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"xelatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","output-file":"lecture_6.pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"block-headings":true,"bibliography":["references.bib"],"editor":"visual","documentclass":"scrreprt"},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}
