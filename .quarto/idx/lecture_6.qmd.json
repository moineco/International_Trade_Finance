{"title":"The Political Economy of Trade Policy","markdown":{"headingText":"The Political Economy of Trade Policy","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nPrevious lectures have answered the question, \"Why do nations trade?\" by describing the causes and effects of international trade and the functioning of a trading world economy. This lecture examines the policies that governments adopt toward international trade, policies that involve a number of different actions. These actions include *taxes*, *subsidies*, *legal limits* on the value or volume of particular imports and other measures.\n\nThe chapter thus provides a framework for understanding the effects of the most important instruments of trade policy.\n\n## Basic Tariff Analysis\n\nA tariff is a tax levied when a good is imported. There are various types of tariff.\n\n-   *Specific tariff* are levied as a fixed charge for each unit of goods imported (for example, \\$3 per barrel of oil).\n\n-   *Ad valorem* tariffs are taxes that are levied as a fraction of the value of the imported goods (for example, a 25 percent U.S. tariff on imported trucks).\n\nTariffs are the oldest form of trade policy and have traditionally been used as a source of government income. Their true purpose is to provide revenue and to protect particular domestic sectors.\n\nThe importance of tariffs has declined in modern times because modern governments usually prefer to protect domestic industries through a variety of non-tariff barriers, such as:\n\n-   Import quotas (limitations on the quantity of imports)\n\n-   Export restraints (limitations on the quantity of exports---usually imposed by the exporting country at the importing country's request).\n\nNonetheless, an understanding of the effects of a tariff remains vital for understanding other trade policies.\n\n## Political economy and trade policy\n\nIn 2008, several developing countries were forced to reduce crop prices domestically. To increase domestic supply for food products, countries like Thailand, Russia, and Ukraine chose to restrict food exports. Such a trade policy was not only politically improper, as it serves only one country's interest, but also economically counter-productive. For example, farmers in Ukraine dumped around â‚¬90 million worth of grain as they harvested more than they could supply domestically, due to the export restrictions, while the world supply was insufficient.\n\nBanning exports may have reduced domestic prices, but importers had to look elsewhere for sources of supply, creating a rise in global crop prices. Thus, such policies produce more costs than benefits as higher the price, the greater the incentive to hoard, which create shifts in prices. Clearly, government policies reflect intentions that go beyond simple measures of cost and benefit.\n\n### Free Trade and Efficiency\n\nThe efficiency case for free trade is simply the reverse of the cost-benefit analysis of a tariff. Figure 6a shows the basic point once again for the case of a small country that cannot influence foreign export prices. A tariff causes a net loss to the economy mea sured by the area of the two triangles; it does so by distorting the economic incentives of both producers and consumers. Conversely, a move to free trade eliminates these distortions and increases national welfare.\n\n![Figure 6a: Efficiency of free trade](figures/Efficiency-Free-Trade.jpg){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"600\"}\n\nIn the modern world, for reasons we will explain later in this chapter, tariff rates are generally low and import quotas relatively rare. As a result, estimates of the total costs of distortions due to tariffs and import quotas tend to be modest in size. Table 6a shows an estimate of the gains from a move to worldwide free trade, measured as a percentage of GDP. For the world as a whole, according to these estimates, protection costs less than 1 percent of GDP. The gains from free trade are somewhat smaller for advanced economies such as the United States and Europe and somewhat larger for poorer \"developing countries.\"\n\n![Table 6a: Benefits of a Move to Worldwide Free Trade (percent of GDP)](figures/Free-Trade-GDP.jpg){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## Some other Instruments of Trade Policy\n\nTariffs are the simplest trade policies, but in the modern world, most government intervention in international trade takes other forms, such as:\n\n-   Export subsidies\n\n-   Import quotas,\n\n-   Voluntary export restraints\n\n-   Local content requirements\n\nFortunately, once we have understood tariffs, it is not too difficult to understand these other trade instruments.\n\n### Export Subsidies\n\nAn export subsidy is a payment to a firm or individual that ships a good abroad. Like a tariff, an export subsidy can be either specific (a fixed sum per unit) or ad valorem (a proportion of the value exported). When the government offers an export subsidy, shippers will export the good up to the point at which the domestic price exceeds the foreign price by the amount of the subsidy.\n\n### Import Quotas\n\nAn import quota is a direct restriction on the quantity of some good that may be imported. The restriction is usually enforced by issuing licenses to some group of individuals or firms. For example, the United States has a quota on imports of foreign cheese. The only firms allowed to import cheese are certain trading companies, each of which is allocated the right to import a maximum number of pounds of cheese each year; the size of each firm's quota is based on the amount of cheese it imported in the past.\n\n### Voluntary Export Restraints\n\nA variant on the import quota is the voluntary export restraint (VER), also known as a voluntary restraint agreement (VRA). A VER is a quota on trade imposed from the exporting country's side instead of the importer's. The most famous example is the limitation on auto exports to the United States enforced by Japan after 1981.\n\n### Local Content Requirements\n\nA local content requirement is a regulation that requires some specified fraction of a final good to be produced domestically. In some cases, this fraction is specified in physical units. In other cases, the requirement is stated in value terms by requiring that some minimum share of the price of a good represent domestic value added. Local content laws have been widely used by developing countries trying to shift their manufacturing base from assembly back into intermediate goods.\n\n## Governments directly influence some trade policy instruments\n\nGovernments influence trade in many other ways. We list some of them briefly.\n\n### Export credit subsidies\n\nThis is like an export subsidy except that it takes the form of a subsidized loan to the buyer. The United States, like most other countries, has a government institution, the Export-Import Bank, devoted to providing at least slightly subsidized loans to aid exports.\n\n### National procurement\n\nPurchases by the government or strongly regulated firms can be directed toward domestically produced goods even when these goods are more expensive than imports. The classic example is the European telecommunications industry. For instance, I Europe, government-owned telephone companies buy from domestic suppliers even when the suppliers charge higher prices than suppliers in other countries.\n\n### Red-tape barriers\n\nSometimes a government wants to restrict imports without doing so formally. Fortunately or unfortunately, it is easy to twist normal health, safety, and customs procedures in order to place substantial obstacles in the way of trade.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"lecture_6.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.165","bibliography":["references.bib"],"editor":"visual","theme":"cosmo"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}},"pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"xelatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","output-file":"lecture_6.pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"block-headings":true,"bibliography":["references.bib"],"editor":"visual","documentclass":"scrreprt"},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}
