We list some of them briefly.\n\n### Export credit subsidies\n\nThis is like an export subsidy except that it takes the form of a subsidized loan to the buyer. The United States, like most other countries, has a government institution, the Export-Import Bank, devoted to providing at least slightly subsidized loans to aid exports.\n\n### National procurement\n\nPurchases by the government or strongly regulated firms can be directed toward domestically produced goods even when these goods are more expensive than imports. The classic example is the European telecommunications industry. For instance, I Europe, government-owned telephone companies buy from domestic suppliers even when the suppliers charge higher prices than suppliers in other countries.\n\n### Red-tape barriers\n\nSometimes a government wants to restrict imports without doing so formally. Fortunately or unfortunately, it is easy to twist normal health, safety, and customs procedures in order to place substantial obstacles in the way of trade.\n\n## The free trade agreements (FTA)\n\nFree trade agreements are treaties that regulate the tariffs, taxes, and duties that countries impose on their imports and exports. The most well-known U.S. regional trade agreement is the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) which replaced the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) effective July 1, 2020.\n\nCurrently, the United States has 14 FTAs with 20 countries. FTAs can help your company to enter and compete more easily in the global marketplace through zero or reduced tariffs and other provisions. While the specifics of each FTA vary, they generally provide for the reduction of trade barriers and the creation of a more predictable and transparent trading and investment environment. This makes it easier and cheaper for U.S. companies to export their products and services to trading partner markets.\n\nNotes:\n\n> Free trade agreements reduce or eliminate barriers to trade across international borders.\n\n> Free trade is the opposite of trade protectionism.\n\n> In the U.S. and the E.U., free trade agreements do not come without regulations and oversight.\n\n### Advantages of Free Trade Agreements\n\n-   Increased Economic Growth\n\n-   More Dynamic Business Climate\n\n-   Lower Government Spending\n\n-   Industry Expertise\n\n-   Technology Transfer\n\n### Disadvantages of Free Trade Agreements\n\n-   Increased Job Outsourcing\n\n-   Theft of Intellectual Property\n\n-   Crowding Out Domestic Industries\n\n-   Poor Working Conditions\n\n-   Reduced Tax Revenue\n\n-   Degradation of Natural Resources\n\n### What is the difference between free trade and fair trade?\n\nAlthough these terms are often confused, there are significant differences between free trade and fair trade. Free trade agreements are aimed at fostering open trade between nations to improve economic growth among all involved parties. The fair trade movement is focused on fostering economic equity on a global scale so that the workers who make goods in other countries receive fair wages and improve their lives and communities.\n\n## Trade and Developing Countries\n\nSo far, we have analyzed the instruments of trade policy and its objectives without specifying the context---that is, without saying much about the country undertaking these policies. Each country has its own distinctive history and issues, but in discussing economic policy, one difference between countries becomes obvious: their income levels.\n\n### What is developing country?\n\nA developing country is a sovereign state with a lesser developed industrial base and a lower Human Development Index (HDI) relative to other countries. However, this definition is not universally agreed upon. There is also no clear agreement on which countries fit this category. The term low and middle-income country (LMIC) is often used interchangeably but refers only to the economy of the countries.\n\n-   The classification of countries based on World Bank:\n\n<https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/new-world-bank-country-classifications-income-level-2022-2023>\n\n-   The classification of countries based on UN:\n\n<https://www.un.org/development/desa/dpad/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/WESP2022_ANNEX.pdf>\n\n> Why are some countries so much poorer than others?\n\n> Why have some countries that were poor a generation ago succeeded in making dramatic progress, while others have not?\n\nTrade policies in many developing countries were strongly influenced by the beliefs that the key to economic development was the creation of a strong manufacturing sector, and that the best way to create that manufacturing sector was to protect domestic manufacturers from international competition.\n\n## Prospects of International Trade of Developing Countries\n\n-   Developing countries have become major players in global trade. Their relative weight has grown enormously, mainly due to China's meteoric rise as an exporter. Though they partly reflect surging oil prices, increasing exports from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), Eastern Europe, and Central Asia have further increased the weight of developing countries in world trade.\n\n-   GDP projections suggest that the share of world trade held by developing countries will expand further, more than doubling over the next 40 years and reaching nearly 70 percent by 2050.\n\n### Trade Liberalization since 1985\n\nBeginning in the mid-1980s, a number of developing countries moved to lower tariff rates and removed import quotas and other restrictions on trade. The shift of developing countries toward freer trade is the big trade policy story of the past two and a half decades.\n\n![Figure 7a: Tariff Rates in Developing Countries](figures/Tariff_Rates_Developing.jpg){width=\"709\"}\n\nAfter 1985, many developing countries reduced tariffs, removed import quotas, and in general opened their economies to import competition. Figure 7a shows trends in tariff rates for an average of all developing countries and for two important developing countries, India and Brazil, which once relied heavily on import substitution as a development strategy. As you can see, there has been a dramatic fall in tariff rates in those two countries. Similar if less drastic changes in trade policy took place in many other developing countries.\n\n![Figure 7b: The Growth of Developing-Country Trade](figures/Growth_Developing_Trade.jpg){width=\"701\"}\n\nTrade liberalization in developing countries had two clear effects. One was a dramatic increase in the volume of trade. Figure 7b plots exports and imports of developing countries, measured as percentages of GDP, since 1970. As you can see, the share of trade in GDP has tripled over that period, with most of the growth happening after 1985.\n\n### Trade and Growth: Takeoff in Asia\n\n![Figure 7c: The Asian Takeoff](figures/Asian_Takeoff.jpg){width=\"701\"}\n\nFigure 7c illustrates the Asian takeoff by showing the experiences of three countries: South Korea, the biggest of the original group of Asian \"tigers\"; China; and India. In each case, we show per-capita GDP as a percentage of the U.S. level, an indicator that highlights the extent of these nations' economic \"catchup.\" As you can see, South Korea began its economic ascent in the 1960s, China at the end of the 1970s, and India circa 1990.\n\n### The Rising Weight of Developing Countries in World Trade\n\n-   Developing countries are already playing an increasing role in world trade. In 2006, they accounted for 30 percent of world exports, up from 19.5 percent in 1996.\n\n-   The share of exports held by the BRIC economies (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) more than doubled, rising from 6 percent to 12.4 percent. China accounted for a significant portion of this rise---its claim of world exports nearly tripled from 2.7 percent to 7.6 percent.\n\n> Trade and investment have risen not only between the rich countries of the North and the developing economies of the South, but also among countries in the South.\n\n### The Rise of South-South Trade\n\n-   Over the past two decades, trade and investment have risen not only between the rich countries of the North and the developing economies of the South, but also among countries in the South, particularly---though not exclusively---involving Asian nations.\n\n-   China and India significantly increased imports from MENA and SSA, partly due to rising commodity demand, with China absorbing \\$32.5 billion in exports from them in 2006, up from just \\$545 million in 1996.\n\n-   Bilateral trade between China and India has grown increasingly significant as well, with exports from China to India jumping from \\$686 million to \\$14.5 billion.\n\n**Reference:** Chapter 11- Trade Policy in Developing Countries (Paul Krugman, Maurice Obstfeld, and Marc Melitz, *International Trade: Theory and Policy*, 11th edition)\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"lecture_7.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.165","bibliography":["references.bib"],"editor":"visual","theme":"cosmo"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}},"pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"xelatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","output-file":"lecture_7.pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"block-headings":true,"bibliography":["references.bib"],"editor":"visual","documentclass":"scrreprt"},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}
