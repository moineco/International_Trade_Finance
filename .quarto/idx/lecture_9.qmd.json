{"title":"Globalization, Trade and the Environment","markdown":{"headingText":"Globalization, Trade and the Environment","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nConcerns about human impacts on the environment are growing in much of the world. In turn, these concerns are playing a growing role in domestic politics. environmental issues are playing a growing role in disputes about international trade as well. Some anti-globalization activists claim that growing international trade automatically harms the environment; some also claim that international trade agreements---and the role of the World Trade Organization in particular---have the effect of blocking environmental action.\n\nMost international economists view the first claim as simplistic and disagree with the second. That is, they deny that there is a simple relationship between globalization and environmental damage and do not believe that trade agreements prevent countries from having enlightened environmental policies. Nonetheless, the intersection of trade and the environment does raise a number of important issues.\n\n## The Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC)\n\n-   Empirical evidence suggests that as economies grow, they initially do increasing environmental damage--but they become more environmentally friendly once they become sufficiently rich. China, where the environment is deteriorating as the economy expands, is in effect moving from A to B. Richer countries may be moving from C to D, using some of their growth to improve the environment.\n\n![Figure 9a: Environmental Kuznet Curve](figures/kuznet_curve_1.jpg)\n\n-   In the early 1990s, Princeton economists Gene Grossman and Alan Krueger, studying the relationship between national income levels and pollutants such as sulfur dioxide, found that these offsetting effects of economic growth lead to a distinctive \"inverted U\" relationship between per-capita income and environmental damage known as the environmental Kuznets curve. This concept, whose relevance has been confirmed by a great deal of further research, is illustrated schematically in Figure 9a.\n\n-   The idea is that as a country's income per-capita rises due to economic growth, the initial effect is growing damage to the environment. Thus, China, whose economy has surged in recent decades, is in effect moving from point A to point B: As the country burns more coal in its power plants and produces more goods in its factories, it emits more sulfur dioxide into the air and dumps more effluent into its rivers.\n\n-   But when a country gets sufficiently rich, it can afford to take action to protect the environment. As the United States has grown richer in recent decades, it has also moved to limit pollution. For example, cars are required to have catalytic converters that reduce smog, and a government-licensing scheme limits emissions of sulfur dioxide from power plants. In terms of Figure 9a, the United States has on some fronts, such as local air pollution, moved from C to D: growing richer and doing less damage to the environment. Figure 9b shows different stages of EKC.\n\n    ![Figure 9b: Different stages in EKC](figures/kuznet_curve.jpg)\n\n## What does Kuznet Curve have to do with international trade?\n\n-   Trade liberalization is often advocated on the grounds that it will promote economic growth. To the extent that it succeeds in accomplishing this end, it will raise per-capita income. Will this improve or worsen environmental quality? It depends which side of the environmental Kuznets curve an economy is on. In their original paper, which was in part a response to critics of the North American Free Trade Agreement who argued that the agreement would be environmentally harmful, Grossman and Krueger suggested that Mexico might be on the right side of the curve---that is, to the extent that NAFTA raises Mexican income, it might actually lead to a reduction in environmental damage.\n\n-   However, the environmental Kuznets curve does not, by any means, necessarily imply that globalization is good for the environment. In fact, it's fairly easy to make the argument that at a world level, globalization has indeed harmed the environment---at least so far.\n\n-   This argument would run as follows: The biggest single beneficiary of globalization has arguably been China, whose export-led economy has experienced incredible growth since 1980. Meanwhile, the single biggest environmental issue is surely climate change: There is broad scientific consensus that emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are leading to a rise in the Earth's average temperature.\n\n-   China's boom has been associated with a huge increase in its emissions of carbon dioxide. Figure 9c shows carbon dioxide emissions of the United States, Europe, and China from 1980 to 2011. In 1980, China was a minor factor in global warming; by 2008, it was, by a substantial margin, the world's leading emitter of greenhouse gases. It's important to realize, though, that the problem here isn't globalization per se---it's China's economic success, which has to some extent come as a result of globalization. And despite environmental concerns, it's difficult to argue that China's growth, which has raised hundreds of millions of people out of dire poverty, is a bad thing.\n\n![Figure 9c: Carbon Dioxide Emissions (The rapid economic growth of China has turned it from a minor factor in climate change to the world\\'s largest emitter of carbon dioxide.)](figures/Carbon_Dioxide_Emissions.jpg){width=\"607\"}\n\n## The Problem of “Pollution Havens”\n\nWhen ships get too old to continue operating, they are disassembled to recover their\nscrap metal and other materials. One way to look at “shipbreaking” is that it is a\nform of recycling: Instead of leaving a ship to rust, a shipbreaking firm extracts and reuses its components. Ultimately, this salvaging means that less iron ore needs to be mined, less oil extracted, and so on. One might expect shipbreaking to be good for the environment.  The task itself, however, can be environmentally hazardous: Everything from the residual oil in a ship’s tanks to the plastic in its chairs and interior fittings, if not handled carefully, can be toxic to the local environment.\n\n\nPollution is the classic example of a negative externality—a cost that individuals\nimpose on others but don’t pay for. That’s why pollution is a valid reason for government intervention. However, different forms of pollution have very different geographical reach—and only those that extend across national boundaries obviously justify international concern.\n\nThus, to the extent that Indian shipbreaking pollutes the local environment.\nthis is a problem for India; it’s less clear that it is a problem for other countries. Similarly, air pollution in Mexico City is a problem for Mexico; it’s not clear why it’s a valid U.S. interest. On the other hand, emissions of carbon dioxide affect the future climate for all countries: They’re an international externality and deserve to be the subject of\ninternational negotiation.\n\n## The Carbon Tariff Dispute\n\nIn 2009, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill that would have created a\ncap-and-trade system for greenhouse gases—that is, a system under which a limited\nnumber of emissions licenses are issued and firms are required to buy enough licenses\nto cover their actual emissions, in effect putting a price on carbon dioxide and other gases. The Senate failed to pass any comparable bill, so climate-change legislation is on hold for the time being. Nonetheless, there was a key trade provision in the House bill that may represent the shape of things to come: It imposed carbon tariffs on imports from countries that fail to enact similar policies.\n\nThe idea behind carbon tariffs is to charge importers of goods from countries without climate-change policies an amount proportional to the carbon\ndioxide emitted in the production of those goods. The charge per ton of emissions\nwould be equal to the price of carbon dioxide emission licenses in the domestic market.\nThis would give overseas producers an incentive to limit their carbon emissions and\nwould remove the incentive to shift production to countries with lax regulation. In\naddition, it would, possibly, give countries with lax regulations an incentive to adopt climate-change policies of their own.\n\nAt this point, the issue of carbon tariffs is hypothetical, since no major economy\nhas yet placed a significant price on greenhouse gas emissions. Correspondingly, the\nWTO hasn’t issued any rulings on the legality of such tariffs, and probably won’t until or unless a real case emerges. But if climate-change legislation makes a comeback—and it is a good bet that it will sooner or later—it will clearly lead to some major new issues in trade policy.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"format-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"lecture_9.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
