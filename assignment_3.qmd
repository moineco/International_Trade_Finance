1. Many European policy analysts criticize the European Union and its member
states for heavily subsidizing basic research. Instead, they say that applied research should be encouraged to generate competitive advantages for European companies.
Explain.


2. What is the main critique against the WTO with respect to environmental protection? How does the WTO justify its position on trade disputes that involve environmental issues?


3. There is growing concern that globalization may allow highly polluting industries
to move to pollution havens, where regulation is looser. There is little evidence
that this is a major factor in actual location decisions, at least so far. But that may change if serious climate-change policies are implemented; in that case, there is a strong case for carbon tariffs, but also strong criticism of the concept. Explain.
