# \>\>\> Assignment 1 {.unnumbered}

## Hint:

-   Suppose that the two countries are Home and Foreign and the two goods are Bread and Cloth. The lone factor of production is labor. The production of one unit of each good in each country requires a certain amount of labor which is called the unit labor requirement.

-   Let's consider:

    -   Home (H)

    -   Foreign (F)

    -   Bread (B)

    -   Cloth (C)

    -   Labor (L)

-   We have the following information

    -   In Home, H_LB = 1

    -   In Home, H_LC = 2

    -   In Foreign, F_LB = 4

    -   In Foreign, F_LC = 3

-   It is easily veriﬁed that Home is better at making both Bread and Cloth because Home requires less labor to produce a unit of Bread and a unit Cloth compared to Foreign.

-   In other words, Home labor is more productive than Foreign in the production of both goods. Thus, Home has an absolute advantage in the production of both Bread and Cloth.

> Recall that the opportunity cost of producing a good is the next best alternative foregone.

-   Home produces one unit of Bread, it uses one unit of labor. The alternative use of labor in Home is to produce Cloth. How much Cloth can one unit of labor in Home produce? The answer is 1/2, because each unit of Cloth requires two units of labor; so, one unit of labor can produce only 1/2 Cloth.

Therefore,

-   The opportunity cost of producing Bread in Home is 1/2 Cloth

-   The ﬂip side of this is that the opportunity cost of producing Cloth in Home is 2 Bread

-   For Foreign, the opportunity cost of producing Bread in Foreign is 4/3 Cloth

-   And the opportunity cost of producing Cloth in Foreign is 3/4 Bread

## Assignment 1:

-   Suppose the unit labor requirements in Home and Foreign for the two goods Cloth and Wheat are as follows.

-   Let's consider:

    -   Home (H)

    -   Foreign (F)

    -   Cloth (C)

    -   Wheat (W)

    -   Labor (L)

-   We have the following data:

    -   In Home, H_LC = 30

    -   In Home, H_LW = 20

    -   In Foreign, F_LC = 60

    -   In Foreign, F_LW = 30
