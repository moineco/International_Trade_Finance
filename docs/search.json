What is international economics about?\n\nInternational Economics consists of two main classifications:\n\nInternational Trade (Microeconomics)\nInternational Finance (Macroeconomics)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparision\nInternational_Trade\nInternational_Finance\n\n\n\n\nEconomics\nMicroeconomics\nMacroeconomics\n\n\nEmployment\nFull employment\nUnder employment\n\n\nSavings\nNo savings\nSavings\n\n\nTrade\nBalance\nImbalance\n\n\nMoney\nReal transaction\nMonetary transaction\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Why study international trade?\n\nProduction technologies do not flow easily across borders. There are massive differences in production technologies across countries.\nThe use of some technologies is tied to human capital which can not be transferred across countries.\nGovernment institutions have a huge impact on the effectiveness of different technologies.\n\n\nWhat are the subjects to focus in international trade discussion?\n\n\nSeven themes recur throughout the study of international economics:\n\nThe gains from trade\nThe pattern of trade\nProtectionism\nThe balance of payments\nExchange rate determination\nInternational policy coordination\nThe international capital market\n\n\n3. What is Globalization?\n\nIncrease in international transactions in markets for goods, services, and factors\nGrowth and expanded scope of international institutions and organizations, for instance, UN, World Bank, IMF, WTO\n\n\nHow can globalization be measured?\n\n\nTrade flows: exports and imports of goods\nTrade in services: transportation, healthcare, telecommunications, business services\nForeign asset ownership\nImmigration\nPrice convergence: Possibility of trade may have important effects\n\n4. The Gravity Model\n\nLet’s begin by describing who trades with whom. An empirical relationship known as the gravity model helps to make sense of the value of trade between any pair of countries and sheds light on the impediments that continue to limit international trade even in today’s global economy.\nThree of the top 15 U.S. trading partners are European nations: Germany, the United Kingdom, and France. Why does the United States trade more heavily with these three European countries than with others? The answer is that these are the three largest European economies. That is, they have the highest values of gross domestic product (GDP), which measures the total value of all goods and services produced in an economy.\n\n\nThere is a strong empirical relationship between the size of a country’s economy and the volume of both its imports and its exports."

    "text": "The gains from trade\nThe pattern of trade\nHow much trade?\nBalance of payments\nExchange rate determination\nInternational policy coordination\nInternational capital market\n\n1. The gains from trade\n\nProbably the most important single insight in all of international economics is that there are gains from trade that is, when countries sell goods and services to each other, this exchange is almost always to their mutual benefit.\nAlthough nations generally gain from international trade, it is quite possible that international trade may hurt particular groups within nations—in other words, that international trade will have strong effects on the distribution of income.\n\n\nTrade can alter the distribution of income between workers and the owners of capital.\n\n2. The pattern of trade\n\nSome aspects of the pattern of trade are easy to understand. Climate and resources clearly explain why Brazil exports coffee and Saudi Arabia exports oil.\nWhy does Japan export automobiles, while the United States exports aircraft?\nThere are various different models that try to explain the reason behind the pattern of trade.\n\n\n“Who sells what to whom” have been a major question of international economics.\n\n3. How much trade?\n\nAfter World War II the advanced democracies, led by the United States, pursued a broad policy of removing barriers to international trade; this policy reflected the view that free trade was a force not only for prosperity but also for promoting world peace.\nIn 2016, Britain shocked the political establishment by voting to leave the European Union, which guarantees free movement of goods and people among its members.\n\n\nConflicts of interest within nations are usually more important in determining trade policy than conflicts of interest between nations.\n\n4. Balance of payments\n\nThe balance of payments (BOP) tracks international transactions. When funds go into a country, a credit is added to the balance of payments (“BOP”). When funds leave a country, a deduction is made.\nThe balance of payments includes both the current account and capital/financial account.\n\nThe current account (CA) includes a nation’s net trade in goods and services, its net earnings on cross-border investments, and its net transfer payments.\nThe capital/financial account (FA) consists of a nation’s transactions in financial instruments and central bank reserves.\nThe sum of all transactions recorded in the balance of payments should be zero; however, exchange rate fluctuations and differences in accounting practices may hinder this in practice.\n\n\n\nThe BOP has become a central issue for the United States because the nation has run huge trade deficits every year since 1982."
