    "text": "International Economics has come in two separate parts that reflect the microeconomics and macroeconomics. ‘International Trade’ is based on microeconomics reasoning in terms of comparative advantage, economies of scale and product differentiation. ‘International Finance’ is largely conceptualized in terms of ‘open-economy macroeconomics’ which set the focus on exchange-rate regimes, stabilization policies and financial capital flows. The history of economics is full of different attempts to bridge the gaps between international trade and international finance.\n\nThe aim of “International Trade and International Finance” course is to give students a comprehensive understanding of the relevant economic theory and empirical evidence. The lectures will introduce some key ideas on international trade and finance. I will provide a formal discussion of the Ricardian model of trade, which contains one of the great insights in Economics that what matters for the gains from trade to occur is comparative advantage and not absolute advantage. I will introduce the Heckscher–Ohlin model of trade where endowment diﬀerences among countries play a key role in determining the pattern of trade. An important result in this discussion is that international trade can produce winners and losers.\nIncreasing returns and trade are essential concept of this course. I will focus on the Krugman model or the model of trade based on internal economies of scale in production. It shows how countries can gain from trade even in a world where countries have identical endowments and technologies, provided that production functions exhibit increasing returns to scale and consumers have a love for variety. I will also develop a discussion of the various commercial policy instruments, such as tariﬀs, quotas and export subsidies, that countries use to intervene in trade. Next, we will study the economics of preferential trading agreements, and the concluding chapter provides a history of multilateral trading agreements under the aegis of GATT (General Agreement on Tariﬀs and Trade) and its evolution into the World Trade Organization (WTO).\n\n\n\n\n\nLecture 1: Basics of International Economics\nLecture 2: Introduction to International Trade\nLecture 3: Reasons of International Trade\nLecture 4: International Trade Models\n\n\n\n\n\nLecture 5: The Instruments of Trade Policy\nLecture 6: The Political Economy of Trade Policy\nLecture 7: Trade Policy in Developing Countries: Part A\nLecture 8: Trade Policy in Developing Countries: Part B\n\n\n\n\n\nLecture 9: Globalization, Trade and the Environment\nLecture 10: National Income Accounting and the Balance of Payments: Part A\nLecture 11: National Income Accounting and the Balance of Payments: Part B\nLecture 12: Money, Interest Rates, and Exchange Rates\n\n\n\n\n\nLecture 13: Economic Geography: Part A\nLecture 14: Economic Geography: Part B\nLecture 15: Developing Countries Growth, Crisis, and Reform\n\nCourse logistic\nClass schedule in third quarter:\n-   Monday from 13:30 JST\n-   Thursday from 13:30 JST\nClass room: A108, Eikokuji Campus, Kochi University of Technology\nGrading\nYour grade evaluation will depend on following three factors:\n\n\n\nPerformance\nWeight\n\n\n\n\na.

This situation is rather common because low income means that the economy or business cannot afford to invest in expensive capital.\nBefore the industrial revolution, 90% of the workforce was employed in agriculture. Producing food was very labor-intensive.\n\n\n\n2.6.2 What is capital intensive industry?\n\nCapital intensive refers to the production that requires higher capital investment such as financial resources, sophisticated machinery, more automated machines, the latest equipment, etc.\nCapital intensive industries pose higher barriers to entry as they require more investment in equipment and machinery to produce goods and services.\nGood examples of capital intensive industries include the oil refining industry, telecommunications industry, airline industry, and public transport authorities that maintain the roads, railways, trains, trams, etc.\n\n\n\n2.6.3 Differences between capital intensive and labor intensive industries\n\nCapital intensive and labor intensive refer to types of production methods followed in the production of goods and services.\nCapital intensive production requires more equipment and machinery to produce goods; therefore, require a larger financial investment.\nLabor intensive refers to production that requires a higher labor input to carry out production activities in comparison to the amount of capital required.\n\nReference: Chapter 1- Introduction (Paul Krugman, Maurice Obstfeld, and Marc Melitz, International Economics, 12th edition)"

    "section": "3.2 Trade based on absolute advantage: Adam Smith",
    "text": "3.2 Trade based on absolute advantage: Adam Smith\n\nThe theory of absolute advantage, developed by Adam Smith. He started with the simple truth that for two nations to trade with each other voluntarily, both nations must gain. If one nation gained nothing or lost, it would simply refuse to trade. But how does this mutually beneﬁcial trade take place, and from where do these gains from trade come?\nAccording to Adam Smith, trade between two nations is based on absolute advantage. When one nation is more efﬁcient than (or has an absolute advantage over) another in the production of one commodity but is less efﬁcient than (or has an absolute disadvantage with respect to) the other nation in producing a second commodity, then both nations can gain by each specializing in the production of the commodity of its absolute advantage and exchanging part of its output with the other nation for the commodity of its absolute disadvantage.\nBy this process, resources are utilized in the most efﬁcient way and the output of both commodities will rise. This increase in the output of both commodities measures the gains from specialization in production available to be divided between the two nations through trade.\nFor example, because of climatic conditions, Canada is efﬁcient in growing wheat but inefﬁcient in growing bananas (hothouses would have to be used). On the other hand, Nicaragua is efﬁcient in growing bananas but inefﬁcient in growing wheat. Thus, Canada has an absolute advantage over Nicaragua in the cultivation of wheat but an absolute dis- advantage in the cultivation of bananas. The opposite is true for Nicaragua.\nUnder these circumstances, both nations would beneﬁt if each specialized in the production of the commodity of its absolute advantage and then traded with the other nation. Canada would specialize in the production of wheat (i.e., produce more than needed domestically) and exchange some of it for (surplus) bananas grown in Nicaragua. As a result, both more wheat and more bananas would be grown and consumed, and both Canada and Nicaragua would gain.\nThus, while the mercantilists believed that one nation could gain only at the expense of another nation and advocated strict government control of all economic activity and trade, Adam Smith (and the other classical economists who followed him) believed that all nations would gain from free trade and strongly advocated a policy of laissez-faire (i.e., as little government interference with the economic system as possible).\nFree trade would cause world resources to be utilized most efﬁciently and would maximize world welfare. There were to be only a few exceptions to this policy of laissez-faire and free trade. One of these was the protection of industries important for national defense.\n\n\nIn view of this belief, it seems paradoxical that today most nations impose many restrictions on the free ﬂow of international trade.\n\n\n3.2.1 Example of absolute advantage:\n\none hour of labor time produces six kilograms of wheat in the United States but only one in the United Kingdom.\nOn the other hand, one hour of labor time produces ﬁve units of cloths in the United Kingdom but only four in the United States.\nThus, the United States is more efﬁcient than, or has an absolute advantage over, the United Kingdom in the production of wheat, whereas the United Kingdom is more efﬁcient than, or has an absolute advantage over, the United States in the production of cloth.\nWith trade, the United States would specialize in the production of wheat and exchange part of it for British cloth. The opposite is true for the United Kingdom.\n\nTable 3.1: Absolute advantage\n\n\n\n\nUSA\nUK\n\n\n\n\nWheat\n6\n1\n\n\nCloth\n4\n5\n\n\n\n\nAbsolute advantage, however, can explain only a very small part of world trade today, such as some of the trade between developed and developing countries. Most of world trade, especially trade among developed countries, could not be explained by absolute advantage."

    "text": "3.3 Trade based on comparative advantage: David Ricardo\n\nDavid Ricardo, writing some 40 years after Smith, to truly explain the pattern of and the gains from trade with his law of comparative advantage.\nThe law of comparative advantage is one of the most important laws of economics, with applicability to nations as well as to individuals and useful for exposing many serious fallacies in apparently logical reasoning.\n\n\n3.3.1 The law of comparative advantage\n\nAccording to the law of comparative advantage, even if one nation is less efﬁcient than the other nation in the production of both commodities, there is still a basis for mutually beneﬁcial trade. The ﬁrst nation should specialize in the production and export of the commodity in which its absolute disadvantage is smaller (this is the commodity of its comparative advantage) and import the commodity in which its absolute disadvantage is greater.\nThe statement of the law can be clariﬁed by looking at Table 3.2. The only difference between Tables 3.2 and 3.1 is that the United Kingdom now produces only two units of cloth per hour instead of ﬁve. Thus, the United Kingdom now has an absolute disadvantage in the production of both wheat and cloth with respect to the United States.\nHowever, since U.K. labor is half as productive in cloth but six times less productive in wheat with respect to the United States, the United Kingdom has a comparative advantage in cloth.\nOn the other hand, the United States has an absolute advantage in both wheat and cloth with respect to the United Kingdom, but since its absolute advantage is greater in wheat (6:1) than in cloth (4:2), the United States has a comparative advantage in wheat.\nAccording to the law of comparative advantage, both nations can gain if the United States specializes in the production of wheat and exports some of it in exchange for British cloth. At the same time, the United Kingdom is specializing in the production and exporting of cloth.\n\nTable 3.2: Comparative advantage\n\n\n\n\nUSA\nUK\n\n\n\n\nWheat\n6\n1\n\n\nCloth\n4\n2"

But additional increases typically cause relatively smaller reductions in crime, and paying for enough police and security to reduce crime to nothing at all would be tremendously expensive.\nThe curvature of the production possibilities frontier shows that as additional resources are added to education, moving from left to right along the horizontal axis, the original gains are fairly large, but gradually diminish.

How to determine what a society desires can be a controversial question, and is usually discussed in political science, sociology, and philosophy classes as well as in economics. At its most basic, allocative efficiency means producers supply the quantity of each product that consumers demand.

Their true purpose is to provide revenue and to protect particular domestic sectors.\nThe importance of tariffs has declined in modern times because modern governments usually prefer to protect domestic industries through a variety of non-tariff barriers, such as:\n\nImport quotas (limitations on the quantity of imports)\nExport restraints (limitations on the quantity of exports—usually imposed by the exporting country at the importing country’s request).\n\nNonetheless, an understanding of the effects of a tariff remains vital for understanding other trade policies."

    "text": "6.2 Political economy and trade policy\nIn 2008, several developing countries were forced to reduce crop prices domestically. To increase domestic supply for food products, countries like Thailand, Russia, and Ukraine chose to restrict food exports. Such a trade policy was not only politically improper, as it serves only one country’s interest, but also economically counter-productive. For example, farmers in Ukraine dumped around €90 million worth of grain as they harvested more than they could supply domestically, due to the export restrictions, while the world supply was insufficient.\nBanning exports may have reduced domestic prices, but importers had to look elsewhere for sources of supply, creating a rise in global crop prices. Thus, such policies produce more costs than benefits as higher the price, the greater the incentive to hoard, which create shifts in prices. Clearly, government policies reflect intentions that go beyond simple measures of cost and benefit.\n\n6.2.1 Free Trade and Efficiency\nThe efficiency case for free trade is simply the reverse of the cost-benefit analysis of a tariff. Figure 6a shows the basic point once again for the case of a small country that cannot influence foreign export prices. A tariff causes a net loss to the economy mea sured by the area of the two triangles; it does so by distorting the economic incentives of both producers and consumers. Conversely, a move to free trade eliminates these distortions and increases national welfare.\n\n\n\nFigure 6a: Efficiency of free trade\n\n\nIn the modern world, for reasons we will explain later in this chapter, tariff rates are generally low and import quotas relatively rare. As a result, estimates of the total costs of distortions due to tariffs and import quotas tend to be modest in size. Table 6a shows an estimate of the gains from a move to worldwide free trade, measured as a percentage of GDP. For the world as a whole, according to these estimates, protection costs less than 1 percent of GDP. The gains from free trade are somewhat smaller for advanced economies such as the United States and Europe and somewhat larger for poorer “developing countries.”\n\nTable 6.1: Benefits of Free Trade (Source: William Cline, Trade Policy and Global Poverty)\n\n\nCountry or region\nGrowth of GDP in percentage\n\n\n\n\nUnited States\n0.57\n\n\nEuropean Union\n0.61\n\n\nJapan\n0.85\n\n\nDeveloping Countries\n1.4\n\n\nWorld\n0.93\n\n\n\nBecause tariff rates are already low for most of the countries, the estimated benefit to free trade is not significantly high for many nations and regions of the world.\n\nTable 6b: Effects of Alternative Trade Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolicy\nTariff\nExport Subsidy\nImport Quota\nVoluntary Export Restraint\n\n\n\n\nProducer benefit\nIncreases\nIncreases\nIncreases\nIncreases\n\n\nConsumer benefit\nFalls\nFalls\nFalls\nFalls\n\n\nGovernment revenue\nIncreases\nFalls\nNo change\nNo change\n\n\nOverall national welfare\nAmbiguous (falls for small country)\nFalls\nAmbiguous (falls for small country)\nFalls\n\n\n\nAll four trade policies benefit producers and hurt consumers.

Like a tariff, an export subsidy can be either specific (a fixed sum per unit) or ad valorem (a proportion of the value exported). When the government offers an export subsidy, shippers will export the good up to the point at which the domestic price exceeds the foreign price by the amount of the subsidy.\n\n\n6.3.2 Import Quotas\nAn import quota is a direct restriction on the quantity of some good that may be imported. The restriction is usually enforced by issuing licenses to some group of individuals or firms. For example, the United States has a quota on imports of foreign cheese. The only firms allowed to import cheese are certain trading companies, each of which is allocated the right to import a maximum number of pounds of cheese each year; the size of each firm’s quota is based on the amount of cheese it imported in the past.\n\n\n6.3.3 Voluntary Export Restraints\nA variant on the import quota is the voluntary export restraint (VER), also known as a voluntary restraint agreement (VRA). A VER is a quota on trade imposed from the exporting country’s side instead of the importer’s. The most famous example is the limitation on auto exports to the United States enforced by Japan after 1981.\n\n\n6.3.4 Local Content Requirements\nA local content requirement is a regulation that requires some specified fraction of a final good to be produced domestically. In some cases, this fraction is specified in physical units. In other cases, the requirement is stated in value terms by requiring that some minimum share of the price of a good represent domestic value added. Local content laws have been widely used by developing countries trying to shift their manufacturing base from assembly back into intermediate goods."

    "text": "7.4 The Infant Industry Argument\n\nAccording to the infant industry argument, developing countries have a potential comparative advantage in manufacturing, but new manufacturing industries in developing countries cannot initially compete with well-established manufacturing in developed countries.\nTo allow manufacturing to get a toehold, then, governments should temporarily support new industries until they have grown strong enough to meet international competition. Thus, it makes sense, according to this argument, to use tariffs or import quotas as temporary measures to get industrialization started.\n\n\n7.4.1 Problems with the Infant Industry Argument\nThe infant industry argument seems highly plausible, and in fact it has been persuasive to many governments. Yet economists have pointed out many pitfalls in the argument, suggesting that it must be used cautiously.\n\nFirst, it is not always a good idea to try to move today into the industries that will have a comparative advantage in the future. Suppose a country that is currently labor-abundant is in the process of accumulating capital. When it accumulates enough capital, it will have a comparative advantage in capital-intensive industries. However, that does not mean it should try to develop these industries immediately.\nSecond, protecting manufacturing does no good unless the protection itself helps make industry competitive. For example, Pakistan and India have protected their manufacturing sectors for decades and have recently begun to develop significant exports of manufactured goods. The goods they export, however, are light manufactures like textiles, not the heavy manufactures that they protected; a good case can be made that they would have developed their manufactured exports even if they had never protected manufacturing.\nMore generally, the fact that it is costly and time-consuming to build up an industry is not an argument for government intervention unless there is some domestic market failure.\n\nReference: Chapter 11- Trade Policy in Developing Countries (Paul Krugman, Maurice Obstfeld, and Marc Melitz, International Trade: Theory and Policy, 11th edition)"

The shift of developing countries toward freer trade is the big trade policy story of the past two and a half decades.\n\n\n\nFigure 7a: Tariff Rates in Developing Countries\n\n\nAfter 1985, many developing countries reduced tariffs, removed import quotas, and in general opened their economies to import competition. Figure 7a shows trends in tariff rates for an average of all developing countries and for two important developing countries, India and Brazil, which once relied heavily on import substitution as a development strategy.

Similar if less drastic changes in trade policy took place in many other developing countries.\n\n\n\nFigure 7b: The Growth of Developing-Country Trade\n\n\nTrade liberalization in developing countries had two clear effects. One was a dramatic increase in the volume of trade. Figure 7b plots exports and imports of developing countries, measured as percentages of GDP, since 1970.

It’s also a growing force in world trade especially in new forms of trade that involve information rather than physical goods. The Indian city of Bangalore has become famous for its growing role in the global information technology industry.\nYet a generation ago, India was a very minor player in world trade. In part this was because the country’s economy performed poorly in general: Until about 1980, India eked out a rate of economic growth—sometimes mocked as the “Hindu rate of growth”—that was only about 1 percentage point higher than population growth. This slow growth was widely attributed to the stifling effect of bureaucratic restrictions. Observers spoke of a “license Raj”: Virtually any kind of business initiative required hard-to-get government permits, which placed a damper on investment and innovation. And India’s sluggish economy participated little in world trade.\nAfter the country achieved independence in 1948, its leaders adopted a particularly extreme form of import-substituting industrialization as the country’s development strategy: India imported almost nothing that it could produce domestically, even if the domestic product was far more expensive and of lower quality than what could be bought abroad. High costs, in turn, crimped exports. So India was a very “closed” economy. In the 1970s, imports and exports averaged only about 5 percent of GDP, close to the lowest levels of any major nation.\nThen everything changed. India’s growth accelerated dramatically: GDP per-capita, which had risen at an annual rate of only 1.3 percent from 1960 to 1980, has grown at close to 4 percent annually since 1980. And India’s participation in world trade surged as tariffs were brought down and import quotas were removed. In short, India has become a high-performance economy. It’s still a very poor country, but it is rapidly growing richer and has begun to rival China as a focus of world attention.\nThe big question, of course, is why India’s growth rate has increased so dramatically. That question is the subject of heated debate among economists. Some have argued that trade liberalization, which allowed India to participate in the global economy, was crucial. Others point out that India’s growth began accelerating around 1980, whereas the big changes in trade policy didn’t occur until the beginning of the 1990s.\nWhatever caused the change, India’s transition has been a welcome development. More than a billion people now have much greater hope for a decent standard of living.\n\n8.2.1 The Rising Weight of Developing Countries in World Trade\n\nDeveloping countries are already playing an increasing role in world trade. In 2006, they accounted for 30 percent of world exports, up from 19.5 percent in 1996.\nThe share of exports held by the BRIC economies (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) more than doubled, rising from 6 percent to 12.4 percent. China accounted for a significant portion of this rise—its claim of world exports nearly tripled from 2.7 percent to 7.6 percent.\n\n\nTrade and investment have risen not only between the rich countries of the North and the developing economies of the South, but also among countries in the South.\n\n\n\n8.2.2 The Rise of South-South Trade\n\nOver the past two decades, trade and investment have risen not only between the rich countries of the North and the developing economies of the South, but also among countries in the South, particularly—though not exclusively—involving Asian nations.\nChina and India significantly increased imports from MENA and SSA, partly due to rising commodity demand, with China absorbing $32.5 billion in exports from them in 2006, up from just $545 million in 1996.\nBilateral trade between China and India has grown increasingly significant as well, with exports from China to India jumping from $686 million to $14.5 billion.\n\nReference: Chapter 11- Trade Policy in Developing Countries (Paul Krugman, Maurice Obstfeld, and Marc Melitz, International Trade: Theory and Policy, 11th edition)"

In turn, these concerns are playing a growing role in domestic politics. environmental issues are playing a growing role in disputes about international trade as well. Some anti-globalization activists claim that growing international trade automatically harms the environment; some also claim that international trade agreements—and the role of the World Trade Organization in particular—have the effect of blocking environmental action.\nMost international economists view the first claim as simplistic and disagree with the second. That is, they deny that there is a simple relationship between globalization and environmental damage and do not believe that trade agreements prevent countries from having enlightened environmental policies. Nonetheless, the intersection of trade and the environment does raise a number of important issues."

    "text": "9.1 The Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC)\n\nEmpirical evidence suggests that as economies grow, they initially do increasing environmental damage–but they become more environmentally friendly once they become sufficiently rich. China, where the environment is deteriorating as the economy expands, is in effect moving from A to B. Richer countries may be moving from C to D, using some of their growth to improve the environment.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9a: Environmental Kuznet Curve\n\n\n\nIn the early 1990s, Princeton economists Gene Grossman and Alan Krueger, studying the relationship between national income levels and pollutants such as sulfur dioxide, found that these offsetting effects of economic growth lead to a distinctive “inverted U” relationship between per-capita income and environmental damage known as the environmental Kuznets curve. This concept, whose relevance has been confirmed by a great deal of further research, is illustrated schematically in Figure 9a.\nThe idea is that as a country’s income per-capita rises due to economic growth, the initial effect is growing damage to the environment. Thus, China, whose economy has surged in recent decades, is in effect moving from point A to point B: As the country burns more coal in its power plants and produces more goods in its factories, it emits more sulfur dioxide into the air and dumps more effluent into its rivers.\nBut when a country gets sufficiently rich, it can afford to take action to protect the environment. As the United States has grown richer in recent decades, it has also moved to limit pollution. For example, cars are required to have catalytic converters that reduce smog, and a government-licensing scheme limits emissions of sulfur dioxide from power plants. In terms of Figure 9a, the United States has on some fronts, such as local air pollution, moved from C to D: growing richer and doing less damage to the environment. Figure 9b shows different stages of EKC.\n\n\n\nFigure 9b: Different stages in EKC"

    "text": "9.2 What does Kuznet Curve have to do with international trade?\n\nTrade liberalization is often advocated on the grounds that it will promote economic growth. To the extent that it succeeds in accomplishing this end, it will raise per-capita income. Will this improve or worsen environmental quality? It depends which side of the environmental Kuznets curve an economy is on. In their original paper, which was in part a response to critics of the North American Free Trade Agreement who argued that the agreement would be environmentally harmful, Grossman and Krueger suggested that Mexico might be on the right side of the curve—that is, to the extent that NAFTA raises Mexican income, it might actually lead to a reduction in environmental damage.\nHowever, the environmental Kuznets curve does not, by any means, necessarily imply that globalization is good for the environment. In fact, it’s fairly easy to make the argument that at a world level, globalization has indeed harmed the environment—at least so far.\nThis argument would run as follows: The biggest single beneficiary of globalization has arguably been China, whose export-led economy has experienced incredible growth since 1980. Meanwhile, the single biggest environmental issue is surely climate change: There is broad scientific consensus that emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are leading to a rise in the Earth’s average temperature.\nChina’s boom has been associated with a huge increase in its emissions of carbon dioxide. Figure 9c shows carbon dioxide emissions of the United States, Europe, and China from 1980 to 2011. In 1980, China was a minor factor in global warming; by 2008, it was, by a substantial margin, the world’s leading emitter of greenhouse gases. It’s important to realize, though, that the problem here isn’t globalization per se—it’s China’s economic success, which has to some extent come as a result of globalization. And despite environmental concerns, it’s difficult to argue that China’s growth, which has raised hundreds of millions of people out of dire poverty, is a bad thing.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9c: Carbon Dioxide Emissions (The rapid economic growth of China has turned it from a minor factor in climate change to the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide.)"

One way to look at “shipbreaking” is that it is a form of recycling: Instead of leaving a ship to rust, a shipbreaking firm extracts and reuses its components. Ultimately, this salvaging means that less iron ore needs to be mined, less oil extracted, and so on. One might expect shipbreaking to be good for the environment. The task itself, however, can be environmentally hazardous: Everything from the residual oil in a ship’s tanks to the plastic in its chairs and interior fittings, if not handled carefully, can be toxic to the local environment.\nPollution is the classic example of a negative externality—a cost that individuals impose on others but don’t pay for. That’s why pollution is a valid reason for government intervention. However, different forms of pollution have very different geographical reach—and only those that extend across national boundaries obviously justify international concern.\nThus, to the extent that Indian shipbreaking pollutes the local environment. this is a problem for India; it’s less clear that it is a problem for other countries. Similarly, air pollution in Mexico City is a problem for Mexico; it’s not clear why it’s a valid U.S. interest. On the other hand, emissions of carbon dioxide affect the future climate for all countries: They’re an international externality and deserve to be the subject of international negotiation."

    "text": "9.4 The Carbon Tariff Dispute\nIn 2009, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill that would have created a cap-and-trade system for greenhouse gases—that is, a system under which a limited number of emissions licenses are issued and firms are required to buy enough licenses to cover their actual emissions, in effect putting a price on carbon dioxide and other gases. The Senate failed to pass any comparable bill, so climate-change legislation is on hold for the time being. Nonetheless, there was a key trade provision in the House bill that may represent the shape of things to come: It imposed carbon tariffs on imports from countries that fail to enact similar policies.\nThe idea behind carbon tariffs is to charge importers of goods from countries without climate-change policies an amount proportional to the carbon dioxide emitted in the production of those goods. The charge per ton of emissions would be equal to the price of carbon dioxide emission licenses in the domestic market. This would give overseas producers an incentive to limit their carbon emissions and would remove the incentive to shift production to countries with lax regulation. In addition, it would, possibly, give countries with lax regulations an incentive to adopt climate-change policies of their own.\nAt this point, the issue of carbon tariffs is hypothetical, since no major economy has yet placed a significant price on greenhouse gas emissions. Correspondingly, the WTO hasn’t issued any rulings on the legality of such tariffs, and probably won’t until or unless a real case emerges. But if climate-change legislation makes a comeback—and it is a good bet that it will sooner or later—it will clearly lead to some major new issues in trade policy."

To distinguish among the different types of expenditure that make up a country’s GNP, government economists and statisticians who compile national income accounts divide GNP among the four possible uses for which a country’s final output is purchased:\n\nConsumption (the amount consumed by private domestic residents)\nInvestment (the amount put aside by private firms to build new plant and equipment for future production),\nGovernment purchases (the amount used by the government), and\nCurrent account balance (the amount of net exports of goods and services to foreigners).\n\nFigure 10a shows how U.S. GNP was divided among its four components in the first quarter of 2016:\n\n\n\nFigure 10a: U.S. GNP and Its Components\n\n\n\nWhy is it useful to divide GNP into consumption, investment, government purchases, and the current account?\n\n\nOne major reason is that we cannot hope to understand the cause of a particular recession or boom without knowing how the main categories of spending have changed. And without such an understanding, we cannot recommend a sound policy response.\nIn addition, the national income accounts provide information essential for studying why some countries are rich—that is, have a high level of GNP relative to population size—while some are poor.\n\n\n\n10.1.2 Gross Domestic Product (GDP)\nA country’s gross domestic product (GDP) is supposed to measure the volume of production within a country’s borders, whereas GNP equals GDP plus net receipts of factor income from the rest of the world.\nMost countries other than the United States have long reported GDP rather than GNP as their primary measure of national economic activity. In 1991, the United States began to follow this practice as well. As a practical matter, movements in GDP and GNP usually do not differ greatly.\n\n\n10.1.3 National Income Accounting for an Open Economy\nWe will see that in open economies, saving and investment are not necessarily equal, as they are in a closed economy.\n\nConsumption (C)\n\nThe portion of GNP purchased by private households to fulfill current wants is called consumption. Purchases of movie tickets, food, dental work, and washing machines all fall into this category. Consumption expenditure is the largest component of GNP in most economies.\nExample: In the United States, for example, the fraction of GNP devoted to consumption has fluctuated in a range from about 62 to 70 percent over the past 60 years.\n\nInvestment (I)\n\nThe part of output used by private firms to produce future output is called investment. Investment spending may be viewed as the portion of GNP used to increase the nation’s stock of capital. Investment is usually more variable than consumption.\nExample: In the United States, (gross) investment has fluctuated between 11 and 22 percent of GNP in recent years.\n\nGovernment Purchases (G)\n\nAny goods and services purchased by federal, state, or local governments are classified as government purchases in the national income accounts. Included in government purchases are federal military spending, government support of cancer research, and government funds spent on highway repair and education. Government purchases include investment as well as consumption purchases.\nExample: Government purchases currently take up about 17 percent of U.S. GNP, and this share has fallen somewhat since the late 1950s. (The corresponding figure for 1959, for example, was around 22 percent.)\n\n\n10.1.4 The National Income Identity for an Open Economy\n\nIn a closed economy, any final good or service not purchased by households or the government must be used by firms to produce new plant, equipment, and inventories.\nThis information leads to a fundamental identity for closed economies. Let Y stand for GNP, C for consumption, I for investment, and G for government purchases. Since all of a closed economy’s output must be consumed, invested, or bought by the government, we can write\n\n\\[Y = C + I + G\\]\n\nResidents of an open economy may spend some of their income on imports, that is, goods and services purchased from abroad, only the portion of their spending not devoted to imports is part of domestic GNP. The value of imports, denoted by IM, must be subtracted from total domestic spending.\nThe goods and services sold to foreigners make up a country’s exports. Exports, denoted by EX, are the amount foreign residents’ purchases add to the national income of the domestic economy.\nThe national income of an open economy is the sum of domestic and foreign expenditures on the goods and services produced by domestic factors of production. Thus, the national income identity for an open economy is\n\n\\[Y = C + I + G + EX - IM\\]"

Of course, when one country lends to another to finance investment, part of the income generated by the investment in future years must be used to pay back the lender.

An asset is any one of the forms in which wealth can be held, such as money, stocks, factories, or government debt. The financial account of the balance of payments records all international purchases or sales of financial assets.\nCertain other activities resulting in transfers of wealth between countries are recorded in the capital account.

    "text": "We are so accustomed to using money that we seldom notice the roles it plays in almost all of our everyday transactions. As with many other modern conveniences, we take money for granted until something goes wrong with it! In fact, the easiest way to appreciate the importance of money is to imagine what economic life would be like without it.\n\n\n\n\nThe most important function of money is to serve as a medium of exchange, a generally accepted means of payment. To see why a medium of exchange is necessary, imagine how time-consuming it would be for people to purchase goods and services in a world where the only type of trade possible is barter trade—the direct trade of goods or services for other goods or services.\nMoney eliminates the enormous search costs connected with a barter system because money is universally acceptable.\nA complex modern economy would cease functioning without some standardized and convenient means of payment.\n\n\n\n\n\nMoney’s second important role is as a unit of account, that is, as a widely recognized measure of value.\nPrices of goods, services, and assets are typically expressed in terms of money. Exchange rates allow us to translate different countries’ money prices into comparable terms.\nThe convention of quoting prices in money terms simplifies economic calculations by making it easy to compare the prices of different commodities.\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause money can be used to transfer purchasing power from the present into the future, it is also an asset, or a store of value. This attribute is essential for any medium of exchange because no one would be willing to accept it in payment if its value in terms of goods and services evaporated immediately.\nMoney’s usefulness as a medium of exchange, however, automatically makes it the most liquid of all assets.vSince money is readily acceptable as a means of payment, money sets the standard against which the liquidity of other assets is judged.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn economy’s money supply is controlled by its central bank. The central bank directly regulates the amount of currency in existence and also has indirect control over the amount of checking deposits issued by private banks.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow individual households and firms determine their demands for money? Three main factors determine aggregate money demand:\n\n\nThe interest rate: A rise in the interest rate causes each individual in the economy to reduce her demand for money.\nThe price level: The economy’s price level is the price of a broad reference basket of goods and services in terms of currency. Generally, the reference basket includes standard, everyday consumption items such as food, clothing, and housing and less routine purchases such as medical care and legal fees. If the price level rises, individual households and firms must spend more money than before to purchase their usual weekly baskets of goods and services. To maintain the same level of liquidity as before the price level increase, they will therefore have to hold more money.\nReal national income: When real national income (GNP) rises, more goods and services are sold in the economy. This increase in the real value of transactions raises the demand for money, given the price level."

All else equal, a depreciation of a country’s currency makes its goods cheaper for foreigners. All else equal, an appreciation of a country’s currency makes its goods more expensive for foreigners.\n\n12.2.1 The Foreign Exchange Market\nThe market in which international currency trades take place is called the foreign exchange market.\n\n12.2.1.1 The Actors\nThe major participants in the foreign exchange market are commercial banks, corporations that engage in international trade, non-bank financial institutions such as asset management firms and insurance companies, and central banks.\nI now describe the major actors in the market and their roles.\n\nCommercial banks: Commercial banks are at the center of the foreign exchange market because almost every sizable international transaction involves the debiting and crediting of accounts at commercial banks in various financial centers. Thus, the vast majority of foreign exchange transactions involve the exchange of bank deposits denominated in different currencies.\nCorporations: Corporations with operations in several countries frequently make or receive payments in currencies other than that of the country in which they are headquartered. To pay workers at a plant in Mexico, for example, IBM may need Mexican pesos. If IBM has only dollars earned by selling computers in the United States, it can acquire the pesos it needs by buying them with its dollars in the foreign exchange market.\nNon-bank financial institutions: Over the years, deregulation of financial markets in the United States, Japan, and other countries has encouraged non-bank financial institutions such as mutual funds to offer their customers a broader range of services, many of them indistinguishable from those offered by banks. Among these have been services involving foreign exchange transactions. Institutional investors such as pension funds often trade foreign currencies. So do insurance companies. Hedge funds, which cater to very wealthy individuals and are not bound by the government regulations that limit mutual funds’ trading strategies, trade actively in the foreign exchange market.\nCentral banks: In the last chapter, we learned that central banks sometimes intervene in foreign exchange markets. While the volume of central bank transactions is typically not large, the impact of these transactions may be great. The reason for this impact is that participants in the foreign exchange market watch central bank actions closely for clues about future macroeconomic policies that may affect exchange rates. Government agencies other than central banks may also trade in the foreign exchange market, but central banks are the most regular official participants."
