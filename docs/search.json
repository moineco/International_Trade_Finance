    "text": "International Economics has come in two separate parts that reflect the microeconomics and macroeconomics. ‘International Trade’ is based on microeconomic reasoning in terms of comparative advantage, economies of scale and product differentiation. ‘International Finance’ is largely conceptualized in terms of ‘open-economy macroeconomics’ which set the focus on exchange-rate regimes, stabilization policies and financial capital flows. The history of economics is full of different attempts to bridge the gaps between international trade and international finance.\n\nThe aim of “International Trade and International Finance” course is to give students a comprehensive understanding of the relevant economic theory and empirical evidence. The lectures will introduce some key ideas on international trade and finance. I will provide a formal discussion of the Ricardian model of trade, which contains one of the great insights in Economics that what matters for the gains from trade to occur is comparative advantage and not absolute advantage. I will introduce the Heckscher–Ohlin model of trade where endowment diﬀerences among countries play a key role in determining the pattern of trade. An important result in this discussion is that international trade can produce winners and losers.\nIncreasing returns and trade are essential concept of this course. I will focus on the Krugman model or the model of trade based on internal economies of scale in production. It shows how countries can gain from trade even in a world where countries have identical endowments and technologies, provided that production functions exhibit increasing returns to scale and consumers have a love for variety. I will also develop a discussion of the various commercial policy instruments, such as tariﬀs, quotas and export subsidies, that countries use to intervene in trade. Next, we will study the economics of preferential trading agreements, and the concluding chapter provides a history of multilateral trading agreements under the aegis of GATT (General Agreement on Tariﬀs and Trade) and its evolution into the World Trade Organization (WTO).\n\n\n\n\n\nLecture 1: Basics of International Economics\nLecture 2: Introduction to International Trade\nLecture 3: Differences between international trade and international finance\nLecture 4: International Trade Models\n\n\n\n\n\nLecture 5: The Instruments of Trade Policy\nLecture 6: The Political Economy of Trade Policy\nLecture 7: Trade Policy in Developing Countries\nLecture 8: Controversies in Trade Policy\n\n\n\n\n\nLecture 9: National Income Accounting\nLecture 10: Exchange Rates and the Foreign Exchange Market\nLecture 11: Money, Interest Rates, and Exchange Rates\nLecture 12: Fixed Exchange Rates and Foreign Exchange Intervention\n\n\n\n\n\nLecture 13: International Monetary Systems\nLecture 14: Financial Globalization\nLecture 15: Developing Countries Growth, Crisis, and Reform\n\nCourse logistic\nClass schedule in third quarter:\n-   Monday from 13:30 JST\n-   Thursday from 13:30 JST\nClass room: A108, Eikokuji Campus, Kochi University of Technology\nGrading\nYour grade evaluation will depend on following three factors:\n\n\n\nPerformance\nWeight\n\n\n\n\na.

    "text": "Probably the most important single insight in all of international economics is that there are gains from trade that is, when countries sell goods and services to each other, this exchange is almost always to their mutual benefit.\nAlthough nations generally gain from international trade, it is quite possible that international trade may hurt particular groups within nations—in other words, that international trade will have strong effects on the distribution of income.\n\n\nTrade can alter the distribution of income between workers and the owners of capital."

    "text": "2.4 Balance of payments\n\nThe balance of payments (BOP) tracks international transactions. When funds go into a country, a credit is added to the balance of payments (“BOP”). When funds leave a country, a deduction is made.\nThe balance of payments includes both the current account and capital/financial account.\n\nThe current account (CA) includes a nation’s net trade in goods and services, its net earnings on cross-border investments, and its net transfer payments.\nThe capital/financial account (FA) consists of a nation’s transactions in financial instruments and central bank reserves.\nThe sum of all transactions recorded in the balance of payments should be zero; however, exchange rate fluctuations and differences in accounting practices may hinder this in practice.\n\n\n\nThe BOP has become a central issue for the United States because the nation has run huge trade deficits every year since 1982."

    "text": "2.9 Labor Intensive and capital intensive industries\n\n2.9.1 What Is labor intensive?\n\nThe term labor intensive refers to a process or industry that requires a large amount of labor to produce its goods or services.\nThe degree of labor intensity is typically measured in proportion to the amount of capital required to produce the goods or services: the higher the proportion of labor costs required, the more labor-intensive the business.\nLabor-intensive industries include restaurants, hotels, agriculture, mining, as well as healthcare and caregiver.\nLess developed economies, as a whole, tend to be more labor-intensive. This situation is rather common because low income means that the economy or business cannot afford to invest in expensive capital.\nBefore the industrial revolution, 90% of the workforce was employed in agriculture. Producing food was very labor-intensive.\n\n\n\n2.9.2 What is capital intensive?\n\nCapital intensive refers to the production that requires higher capital investment such as financial resources, sophisticated machinery, more automated machines, the latest equipment, etc.\nCapital intensive industries pose higher barriers to entry as they require more investment in equipment and machinery to produce goods and services.\nGood examples of capital intensive industries include the oil refining industry, telecommunications industry, airline industry, and public transport authorities that maintain the roads, railways, trains, trams, etc.\n\n\n\n2.9.3 Differences between capital intensive and labor intensive industries\n\nCapital intensive and labor intensive refer to types of production methods followed in the production of goods and services.\nCapital intensive production requires more equipment and machinery to produce goods; therefore, require a larger financial investment.\nLabor intensive refers to production that requires a higher labor input to carry out production activities in comparison to the amount of capital required.\n\nReference: Chapter 1- Introduction (Paul Krugman, Maurice Obstfeld, and Marc Melitz, International Economics, 12th edition)"

An empirical relationship known as the gravity model helps to make sense of the value of trade between any pair of countries and sheds light on the impediments that continue to limit international trade even in today’s global economy.\nThree of the top 15 U.S. trading partners are European nations: Germany, the United Kingdom, and France. Why does the United States trade more heavily with these three European countries than with others? The answer is that these are the three largest European economies. That is, they have the highest values of gross domestic product (GDP), which measures the total value of all goods and services produced in an economy.\n\n\nThere is a strong empirical relationship between the size of a country’s economy and the volume of both its imports and its exports."
