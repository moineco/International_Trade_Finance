    "text": "International Economics has come in two separate parts that reflect the microeconomics and macroeconomics. ‘International Trade’ is based on microeconomics reasoning in terms of comparative advantage, economies of scale and product differentiation. ‘International Finance’ is largely conceptualized in terms of ‘open-economy macroeconomics’ which set the focus on exchange-rate regimes, stabilization policies and financial capital flows. The history of economics is full of different attempts to bridge the gaps between international trade and international finance.\n\nThe aim of “International Trade and International Finance” course is to give students a comprehensive understanding of the relevant economic theory and empirical evidence. The lectures will introduce some key ideas on international trade and finance. I will provide a formal discussion of the Ricardian model of trade, which contains one of the great insights in Economics that what matters for the gains from trade to occur is comparative advantage and not absolute advantage. I will introduce the Heckscher–Ohlin model of trade where endowment diﬀerences among countries play a key role in determining the pattern of trade. An important result in this discussion is that international trade can produce winners and losers.\nIncreasing returns and trade are essential concept of this course. I will focus on the Krugman model or the model of trade based on internal economies of scale in production. It shows how countries can gain from trade even in a world where countries have identical endowments and technologies, provided that production functions exhibit increasing returns to scale and consumers have a love for variety. I will also develop a discussion of the various commercial policy instruments, such as tariﬀs, quotas and export subsidies, that countries use to intervene in trade. Next, we will study the economics of preferential trading agreements, and the concluding chapter provides a history of multilateral trading agreements under the aegis of GATT (General Agreement on Tariﬀs and Trade) and its evolution into the World Trade Organization (WTO).\n\n\n\n\n\nLecture 1: Basics of International Economics\nLecture 2: Introduction to International Trade\nLecture 3: Reasons of International Trade\nLecture 4: International Trade Models\n\n\n\n\n\nLecture 5: The Instruments of Trade Policy\nLecture 6: The Political Economy of Trade Policy\nLecture 7: Trade Policy in Developing Countries\nLecture 8: Controversies in Trade Policy\n\n\n\n\n\nLecture 9: National Income Accounting\nLecture 10: Exchange Rates and the Foreign Exchange Market\nLecture 11: Money, Interest Rates, and Exchange Rates\nLecture 12: Fixed Exchange Rates and Foreign Exchange Intervention\n\n\n\n\n\nLecture 13: International Monetary Systems\nLecture 14: Financial Globalization\nLecture 15: Developing Countries Growth, Crisis, and Reform\n\nCourse logistic\nClass schedule in third quarter:\n-   Monday from 13:30 JST\n-   Thursday from 13:30 JST\nClass room: A108, Eikokuji Campus, Kochi University of Technology\nGrading\nYour grade evaluation will depend on following three factors:\n\n\n\nPerformance\nWeight\n\n\n\n\na.

This situation is rather common because low income means that the economy or business cannot afford to invest in expensive capital.\nBefore the industrial revolution, 90% of the workforce was employed in agriculture. Producing food was very labor-intensive.\n\n\n\n2.6.2 What is capital intensive industry?\n\nCapital intensive refers to the production that requires higher capital investment such as financial resources, sophisticated machinery, more automated machines, the latest equipment, etc.\nCapital intensive industries pose higher barriers to entry as they require more investment in equipment and machinery to produce goods and services.\nGood examples of capital intensive industries include the oil refining industry, telecommunications industry, airline industry, and public transport authorities that maintain the roads, railways, trains, trams, etc.\n\n\n\n2.6.3 Differences between capital intensive and labor intensive industries\n\nCapital intensive and labor intensive refer to types of production methods followed in the production of goods and services.\nCapital intensive production requires more equipment and machinery to produce goods; therefore, require a larger financial investment.\nLabor intensive refers to production that requires a higher labor input to carry out production activities in comparison to the amount of capital required.\n\nReference: Chapter 1- Introduction (Paul Krugman, Maurice Obstfeld, and Marc Melitz, International Economics, 12th edition)"

    "section": "3.2 Trade based on absolute advantage: Adam Smith",
    "text": "3.2 Trade based on absolute advantage: Adam Smith\n\nThe theory of absolute advantage, developed by Adam Smith. He started with the simple truth that for two nations to trade with each other voluntarily, both nations must gain. If one nation gained nothing or lost, it would simply refuse to trade. But how does this mutually beneﬁcial trade take place, and from where do these gains from trade come?\nAccording to Adam Smith, trade between two nations is based on absolute advantage. When one nation is more efﬁcient than (or has an absolute advantage over) another in the production of one commodity but is less efﬁcient than (or has an absolute disadvantage with respect to) the other nation in producing a second commodity, then both nations can gain by each specializing in the production of the commodity of its absolute advantage and exchanging part of its output with the other nation for the commodity of its absolute disadvantage.\nBy this process, resources are utilized in the most efﬁcient way and the output of both commodities will rise. This increase in the output of both commodities measures the gains from specialization in production available to be divided between the two nations through trade.\nFor example, because of climatic conditions, Canada is efﬁcient in growing wheat but inefﬁcient in growing bananas (hothouses would have to be used). On the other hand, Nicaragua is efﬁcient in growing bananas but inefﬁcient in growing wheat. Thus, Canada has an absolute advantage over Nicaragua in the cultivation of wheat but an absolute dis- advantage in the cultivation of bananas. The opposite is true for Nicaragua.\nUnder these circumstances, both nations would beneﬁt if each specialized in the production of the commodity of its absolute advantage and then traded with the other nation. Canada would specialize in the production of wheat (i.e., produce more than needed domestically) and exchange some of it for (surplus) bananas grown in Nicaragua. As a result, both more wheat and more bananas would be grown and consumed, and both Canada and Nicaragua would gain.\nThus, while the mercantilists believed that one nation could gain only at the expense of another nation and advocated strict government control of all economic activity and trade, Adam Smith (and the other classical economists who followed him) believed that all nations would gain from free trade and strongly advocated a policy of laissez-faire (i.e., as little government interference with the economic system as possible).\nFree trade would cause world resources to be utilized most efﬁciently and would maximize world welfare. There were to be only a few exceptions to this policy of laissez-faire and free trade. One of these was the protection of industries important for national defense.\n\n\nIn view of this belief, it seems paradoxical that today most nations impose many restrictions on the free ﬂow of international trade.\n\n\n3.2.1 Example of absolute advantage:\n\none hour of labor time produces six kilograms of wheat in the United States but only one in the United Kingdom.\nOn the other hand, one hour of labor time produces ﬁve units of cloths in the United Kingdom but only four in the United States.\nThus, the United States is more efﬁcient than, or has an absolute advantage over, the United Kingdom in the production of wheat, whereas the United Kingdom is more efﬁcient than, or has an absolute advantage over, the United States in the production of cloth.\nWith trade, the United States would specialize in the production of wheat and exchange part of it for British cloth. The opposite is true for the United Kingdom.\n\nTable 3.1: Absolute advantage\n\n\n\n\nUSA\nUK\n\n\n\n\nWheat\n6\n1\n\n\nCloth\n4\n5\n\n\n\n\nAbsolute advantage, however, can explain only a very small part of world trade today, such as some of the trade between developed and developing countries. Most of world trade, especially trade among developed countries, could not be explained by absolute advantage."

    "text": "3.3 Trade based on comparative advantage: David Ricardo\n\nDavid Ricardo, writing some 40 years after Smith, to truly explain the pattern of and the gains from trade with his law of comparative advantage.\nThe law of comparative advantage is one of the most important laws of economics, with applicability to nations as well as to individuals and useful for exposing many serious fallacies in apparently logical reasoning.\n\n\n3.3.1 The law of comparative advantage\n\nAccording to the law of comparative advantage, even if one nation is less efﬁcient than the other nation in the production of both commodities, there is still a basis for mutually beneﬁcial trade. The ﬁrst nation should specialize in the production and export of the commodity in which its absolute disadvantage is smaller (this is the commodity of its comparative advantage) and import the commodity in which its absolute disadvantage is greater.\nThe statement of the law can be clariﬁed by looking at Table 3.2. The only difference between Tables 3.2 and 3.1 is that the United Kingdom now produces only two units of cloth per hour instead of ﬁve. Thus, the United Kingdom now has an absolute disadvantage in the production of both wheat and cloth with respect to the United States.\nHowever, since U.K. labor is half as productive in cloth but six times less productive in wheat with respect to the United States, the United Kingdom has a comparative advantage in cloth.\nOn the other hand, the United States has an absolute advantage in both wheat and cloth with respect to the United Kingdom, but since its absolute advantage is greater in wheat (6:1) than in cloth (4:2), the United States has a comparative advantage in wheat.\nAccording to the law of comparative advantage, both nations can gain if the United States specializes in the production of wheat and exports some of it in exchange for British cloth. At the same time, the United Kingdom is specializing in the production and exporting of cloth.\n\nTable 3.2: Comparative advantage\n\n\n\n\nUSA\nUK\n\n\n\n\nWheat\n6\n1\n\n\nCloth\n4\n2"

But additional increases typically cause relatively smaller reductions in crime, and paying for enough police and security to reduce crime to nothing at all would be tremendously expensive.\nThe curvature of the production possibilities frontier shows that as additional resources are added to education, moving from left to right along the horizontal axis, the original gains are fairly large, but gradually diminish. Similarly, as additional resources are added to healthcare, moving from bottom to top on the vertical axis, the original gains are fairly large, but again gradually diminish.

All choices on the PPF in this graph, including A, B, C, D, and F, display productive efficiency. As a firm moves from any one of these choices to any other, either healthcare increases and education decreases or vice versa. However, any choice inside the production possibilities frontier is productively inefficient and wasteful because it is possible to produce more of one good, the other good, or some combination of both goods.\nAllocative efficiency means that the particular mix of goods a society produces represents the combination that society most desires. How to determine what a society desires can be a controversial question, and is usually discussed in political science, sociology, and philosophy classes as well as in economics. At its most basic, allocative efficiency means producers supply the quantity of each product that consumers demand.

Their true purpose is to provide revenue and to protect particular domestic sectors.\nThe importance of tariffs has declined in modern times because modern governments usually prefer to protect domestic industries through a variety of non-tariff barriers, such as:\n\nImport quotas (limitations on the quantity of imports)\nExport restraints (limitations on the quantity of exports—usually imposed by the exporting country at the importing country’s request).\n\nNonetheless, an understanding of the effects of a tariff remains vital for understanding other trade policies."

    "text": "6.2 Political economy and trade policy\nIn 2008, several developing countries were forced to reduce crop prices domestically. To increase domestic supply for food products, countries like Thailand, Russia, and Ukraine chose to restrict food exports. Such a trade policy was not only politically improper, as it serves only one country’s interest, but also economically counter-productive. For example, farmers in Ukraine dumped around €90 million worth of grain as they harvested more than they could supply domestically, due to the export restrictions, while the world supply was insufficient.\nBanning exports may have reduced domestic prices, but importers had to look elsewhere for sources of supply, creating a rise in global crop prices. Thus, such policies produce more costs than benefits as higher the price, the greater the incentive to hoard, which create shifts in prices. Clearly, government policies reflect intentions that go beyond simple measures of cost and benefit.\n\n6.2.1 Free Trade and Efficiency\nThe efficiency case for free trade is simply the reverse of the cost-benefit analysis of a tariff. Figure 6a shows the basic point once again for the case of a small country that cannot influence foreign export prices. A tariff causes a net loss to the economy mea sured by the area of the two triangles; it does so by distorting the economic incentives of both producers and consumers. Conversely, a move to free trade eliminates these distortions and increases national welfare.\n\n\n\nFigure 6a: Efficiency of free trade\n\n\nIn the modern world, for reasons we will explain later in this chapter, tariff rates are generally low and import quotas relatively rare. As a result, estimates of the total costs of distortions due to tariffs and import quotas tend to be modest in size. Table 6a shows an estimate of the gains from a move to worldwide free trade, measured as a percentage of GDP. For the world as a whole, according to these estimates, protection costs less than 1 percent of GDP. The gains from free trade are somewhat smaller for advanced economies such as the United States and Europe and somewhat larger for poorer “developing countries.”\n\nTable 6.1: Benefits of Free Trade (Source: William Cline, Trade Policy and Global Poverty)\n\n\nCountry or region\nGrowth of GDP in percentage\n\n\n\n\nUnited States\n0.57\n\n\nEuropean Union\n0.61\n\n\nJapan\n0.85\n\n\nDeveloping Countries\n1.4\n\n\nWorld\n0.93\n\n\n\nBecause tariff rates are already low for most of the countries, the estimated benefit to free trade is not significantly high for many nations and regions of the world.\n\nTable 6b: Effects of Alternative Trade Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolicy\nTariff\nExport Subsidy\nImport Quota\nVoluntary Export Restraint\n\n\n\n\nProducer benefit\nIncreases\nIncreases\nIncreases\nIncreases\n\n\nConsumer benefit\nFalls\nFalls\nFalls\nFalls\n\n\nGovernment revenue\nIncreases\nFalls\nNo change\nNo change\n\n\nOverall national welfare\nAmbiguous (falls for small country)\nFalls\nAmbiguous (falls for small country)\nFalls\n\n\n\nAll four trade policies benefit producers and hurt consumers.

Like a tariff, an export subsidy can be either specific (a fixed sum per unit) or ad valorem (a proportion of the value exported). When the government offers an export subsidy, shippers will export the good up to the point at which the domestic price exceeds the foreign price by the amount of the subsidy.\n\n\n6.3.2 Import Quotas\nAn import quota is a direct restriction on the quantity of some good that may be imported. The restriction is usually enforced by issuing licenses to some group of individuals or firms. For example, the United States has a quota on imports of foreign cheese. The only firms allowed to import cheese are certain trading companies, each of which is allocated the right to import a maximum number of pounds of cheese each year; the size of each firm’s quota is based on the amount of cheese it imported in the past.\n\n\n6.3.3 Voluntary Export Restraints\nA variant on the import quota is the voluntary export restraint (VER), also known as a voluntary restraint agreement (VRA). A VER is a quota on trade imposed from the exporting country’s side instead of the importer’s. The most famous example is the limitation on auto exports to the United States enforced by Japan after 1981.\n\n\n6.3.4 Local Content Requirements\nA local content requirement is a regulation that requires some specified fraction of a final good to be produced domestically. In some cases, this fraction is specified in physical units. In other cases, the requirement is stated in value terms by requiring that some minimum share of the price of a good represent domestic value added. Local content laws have been widely used by developing countries trying to shift their manufacturing base from assembly back into intermediate goods."

The classic example is the European telecommunications industry. For instance, I Europe, government-owned telephone companies buy from domestic suppliers even when the suppliers charge higher prices than suppliers in other countries.\n\n\n\nSometimes a government wants to restrict imports without doing so formally.

The shift of developing countries toward freer trade is the big trade policy story of the past two and a half decades.\n\n\n\nFigure 7a: Tariff Rates in Developing Countries\n\n\nAfter 1985, many developing countries reduced tariffs, removed import quotas, and in general opened their economies to import competition. Figure 7a shows trends in tariff rates for an average of all developing countries and for two important developing countries, India and Brazil, which once relied heavily on import substitution as a development strategy.

Similar if less drastic changes in trade policy took place in many other developing countries.\n\n\n\nFigure 7b: The Growth of Developing-Country Trade\n\n\nTrade liberalization in developing countries had two clear effects. One was a dramatic increase in the volume of trade. Figure 7b plots exports and imports of developing countries, measured as percentages of GDP, since 1970. As you can see, the share of trade in GDP has tripled over that period, with most of the growth happening after 1985.\n\n\n7.5.2 Trade and Growth: Takeoff in Asia\n\n\n\nFigure 7c: The Asian Takeoff\n\n\nFigure 7c illustrates the Asian takeoff by showing the experiences of three countries: South Korea, the biggest of the original group of Asian “tigers”; China; and India. In each case, we show per-capita GDP as a percentage of the U.S. level, an indicator that highlights the extent of these nations’ economic “catchup.” As you can see, South Korea began its economic ascent in the 1960s, China at the end of the 1970s, and India circa 1990.\n\n\n7.5.3 The Rising Weight of Developing Countries in World Trade\n\nDeveloping countries are already playing an increasing role in world trade. In 2006, they accounted for 30 percent of world exports, up from 19.5 percent in 1996.\nThe share of exports held by the BRIC economies (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) more than doubled, rising from 6 percent to 12.4 percent. China accounted for a significant portion of this rise—its claim of world exports nearly tripled from 2.7 percent to 7.6 percent.\n\n\nTrade and investment have risen not only between the rich countries of the North and the developing economies of the South, but also among countries in the South.\n\n\n\n7.5.4 The Rise of South-South Trade\n\nOver the past two decades, trade and investment have risen not only between the rich countries of the North and the developing economies of the South, but also among countries in the South, particularly—though not exclusively—involving Asian nations.\nChina and India significantly increased imports from MENA and SSA, partly due to rising commodity demand, with China absorbing $32.5 billion in exports from them in 2006, up from just $545 million in 1996.\nBilateral trade between China and India has grown increasingly significant as well, with exports from China to India jumping from $686 million to $14.5 billion.\n\nReference: Chapter 11- Trade Policy in Developing Countries (Paul Krugman, Maurice Obstfeld, and Marc Melitz, International Trade: Theory and Policy, 11th edition)"

One was a dramatic increase in the volume of trade. Figure 7b plots exports and imports of developing countries, measured as percentages of GDP, since 1970. As you can see, the share of trade in GDP has tripled over that period, with most of the growth happening after 1985.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7c: The Asian Takeoff\n\n\nFigure 7c illustrates the Asian takeoff by showing the experiences of three countries: South Korea, the biggest of the original group of Asian “tigers”; China; and India. In each case, we show per-capita GDP as a percentage of the U.S. level, an indicator that highlights the extent of these nations’ economic “catchup.” As you can see, South Korea began its economic ascent in the 1960s, China at the end of the 1970s, and India circa 1990.\n\n\n\n\nDeveloping countries are already playing an increasing role in world trade. In 2006, they accounted for 30 percent of world exports, up from 19.5 percent in 1996.\nThe share of exports held by the BRIC economies (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) more than doubled, rising from 6 percent to 12.4 percent. China accounted for a significant portion of this rise—its claim of world exports nearly tripled from 2.7 percent to 7.6 percent.\n\n\nTrade and investment have risen not only between the rich countries of the North and the developing economies of the South, but also among countries in the South.\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the past two decades, trade and investment have risen not only between the rich countries of the North and the developing economies of the South, but also among countries in the South, particularly—though not exclusively—involving Asian nations.\nChina and India significantly increased imports from MENA and SSA, partly due to rising commodity demand, with China absorbing $32.5 billion in exports from them in 2006, up from just $545 million in 1996.\nBilateral trade between China and India has grown increasingly significant as well, with exports from China to India jumping from $686 million to $14.5 billion.\n\nReference: Chapter 11- Trade Policy in Developing Countries (Paul Krugman, Maurice Obstfeld, and Marc Melitz, International Trade: Theory and Policy, 11th edition)"

    "text": "7.4 The Infant Industry Argument\n\nAccording to the infant industry argument, developing countries have a potential comparative advantage in manufacturing, but new manufacturing industries in developing countries cannot initially compete with well-established manufacturing in developed countries.\nTo allow manufacturing to get a toehold, then, governments should temporarily support new industries until they have grown strong enough to meet international competition. Thus, it makes sense, according to this argument, to use tariffs or import quotas as temporary measures to get industrialization started.\n\n\n7.4.1 Problems with the Infant Industry Argument\nThe infant industry argument seems highly plausible, and in fact it has been persuasive to many governments. Yet economists have pointed out many pitfalls in the argument, suggesting that it must be used cautiously.\n\nFirst, it is not always a good idea to try to move today into the industries that will have a comparative advantage in the future. Suppose a country that is currently labor-abundant is in the process of accumulating capital. When it accumulates enough capital, it will have a comparative advantage in capital-intensive industries. However, that does not mean it should try to develop these industries immediately.\nSecond, protecting manufacturing does no good unless the protection itself helps make industry competitive. For example, Pakistan and India have protected their manufacturing sectors for decades and have recently begun to develop significant exports of manufactured goods. The goods they export, however, are light manufactures like textiles, not the heavy manufactures that they protected; a good case can be made that they would have developed their manufactured exports even if they had never protected manufacturing.\nMore generally, the fact that it is costly and time-consuming to build up an industry is not an argument for government intervention unless there is some domestic market failure.\n\nReference: Chapter 11- Trade Policy in Developing Countries (Paul Krugman, Maurice Obstfeld, and Marc Melitz, International Trade: Theory and Policy, 11th edition)"
