    "text": "International Economics has come in two separate parts that reflect the microeconomics and macroeconomics. ‘International Trade’ is based on microeconomics reasoning in terms of comparative advantage, economies of scale and product differentiation. ‘International Finance’ is largely conceptualized in terms of ‘open-economy macroeconomics’ which set the focus on exchange-rate regimes, stabilization policies and financial capital flows. The history of economics is full of different attempts to bridge the gaps between international trade and international finance.\n\nThe aim of “International Trade and International Finance” course is to give students a comprehensive understanding of the relevant economic theory and empirical evidence. The lectures will introduce some key ideas on international trade and finance. I will provide a formal discussion of the Ricardian model of trade, which contains one of the great insights in Economics that what matters for the gains from trade to occur is comparative advantage and not absolute advantage. I will introduce the Heckscher–Ohlin model of trade where endowment diﬀerences among countries play a key role in determining the pattern of trade. An important result in this discussion is that international trade can produce winners and losers.\nIncreasing returns and trade are essential concept of this course. I will focus on the Krugman model or the model of trade based on internal economies of scale in production. It shows how countries can gain from trade even in a world where countries have identical endowments and technologies, provided that production functions exhibit increasing returns to scale and consumers have a love for variety. I will also develop a discussion of the various commercial policy instruments, such as tariﬀs, quotas and export subsidies, that countries use to intervene in trade. Next, we will study the economics of preferential trading agreements, and the concluding chapter provides a history of multilateral trading agreements under the aegis of GATT (General Agreement on Tariﬀs and Trade) and its evolution into the World Trade Organization (WTO).\n\n\n\n\n\nLecture 1: Basics of International Economics\nLecture 2: Introduction to International Trade\nLecture 3: Reasons of International Trade\nLecture 4: International Trade Models\n\n\n\n\n\nLecture 5: The Instruments of Trade Policy\nLecture 6: The Political Economy of Trade Policy\nLecture 7: Trade Policy in Developing Countries\nLecture 8: Controversies in Trade Policy\n\n\n\n\n\nLecture 9: National Income Accounting\nLecture 10: Exchange Rates and the Foreign Exchange Market\nLecture 11: Money, Interest Rates, and Exchange Rates\nLecture 12: Fixed Exchange Rates and Foreign Exchange Intervention\n\n\n\n\n\nLecture 13: International Monetary Systems\nLecture 14: Financial Globalization\nLecture 15: Developing Countries Growth, Crisis, and Reform\n\nCourse logistic\nClass schedule in third quarter:\n-   Monday from 13:30 JST\n-   Thursday from 13:30 JST\nClass room: A108, Eikokuji Campus, Kochi University of Technology\nGrading\nYour grade evaluation will depend on following three factors:\n\n\n\nPerformance\nWeight\n\n\n\n\na.

This situation is rather common because low income means that the economy or business cannot afford to invest in expensive capital.\nBefore the industrial revolution, 90% of the workforce was employed in agriculture. Producing food was very labor-intensive.\n\n\n\n2.6.2 What is capital intensive industry?\n\nCapital intensive refers to the production that requires higher capital investment such as financial resources, sophisticated machinery, more automated machines, the latest equipment, etc.\nCapital intensive industries pose higher barriers to entry as they require more investment in equipment and machinery to produce goods and services.\nGood examples of capital intensive industries include the oil refining industry, telecommunications industry, airline industry, and public transport authorities that maintain the roads, railways, trains, trams, etc.\n\n\n\n2.6.3 Differences between capital intensive and labor intensive industries\n\nCapital intensive and labor intensive refer to types of production methods followed in the production of goods and services.\nCapital intensive production requires more equipment and machinery to produce goods; therefore, require a larger financial investment.\nLabor intensive refers to production that requires a higher labor input to carry out production activities in comparison to the amount of capital required.\n\nReference: Chapter 1- Introduction (Paul Krugman, Maurice Obstfeld, and Marc Melitz, International Economics, 12th edition)"

    "section": "3.2 Trade based on absolute advantage: Adam Smith",
    "text": "3.2 Trade based on absolute advantage: Adam Smith\n\nThe theory of absolute advantage, developed by Adam Smith. He started with the simple truth that for two nations to trade with each other voluntarily, both nations must gain. If one nation gained nothing or lost, it would simply refuse to trade. But how does this mutually beneﬁcial trade take place, and from where do these gains from trade come?\nAccording to Adam Smith, trade between two nations is based on absolute advantage. When one nation is more efﬁcient than (or has an absolute advantage over) another in the production of one commodity but is less efﬁcient than (or has an absolute disadvantage with respect to) the other nation in producing a second commodity, then both nations can gain by each specializing in the production of the commodity of its absolute advantage and exchanging part of its output with the other nation for the commodity of its absolute disadvantage.\nBy this process, resources are utilized in the most efﬁcient way and the output of both commodities will rise. This increase in the output of both commodities measures the gains from specialization in production available to be divided between the two nations through trade.\nFor example, because of climatic conditions, Canada is efﬁcient in growing wheat but inefﬁcient in growing bananas (hothouses would have to be used). On the other hand, Nicaragua is efﬁcient in growing bananas but inefﬁcient in growing wheat. Thus, Canada has an absolute advantage over Nicaragua in the cultivation of wheat but an absolute dis- advantage in the cultivation of bananas. The opposite is true for Nicaragua.\nUnder these circumstances, both nations would beneﬁt if each specialized in the production of the commodity of its absolute advantage and then traded with the other nation. Canada would specialize in the production of wheat (i.e., produce more than needed domestically) and exchange some of it for (surplus) bananas grown in Nicaragua. As a result, both more wheat and more bananas would be grown and consumed, and both Canada and Nicaragua would gain.\nThus, while the mercantilists believed that one nation could gain only at the expense of another nation and advocated strict government control of all economic activity and trade, Adam Smith (and the other classical economists who followed him) believed that all nations would gain from free trade and strongly advocated a policy of laissez-faire (i.e., as little government interference with the economic system as possible).\nFree trade would cause world resources to be utilized most efﬁciently and would maximize world welfare. There were to be only a few exceptions to this policy of laissez-faire and free trade. One of these was the protection of industries important for national defense.\n\n\nIn view of this belief, it seems paradoxical that today most nations impose many restrictions on the free ﬂow of international trade.\n\n\n3.2.1 Example of absolute advantage:\n\none hour of labor time produces six kilograms of wheat in the United States but only one in the United Kingdom.\nOn the other hand, one hour of labor time produces ﬁve units of cloths in the United Kingdom but only four in the United States.\nThus, the United States is more efﬁcient than, or has an absolute advantage over, the United Kingdom in the production of wheat, whereas the United Kingdom is more efﬁcient than, or has an absolute advantage over, the United States in the production of cloth.\nWith trade, the United States would specialize in the production of wheat and exchange part of it for British cloth. The opposite is true for the United Kingdom.\n\nTable 3.1: Absolute advantage\n\n\n\n\nUSA\nUK\n\n\n\n\nWheat\n6\n1\n\n\nCloth\n4\n5\n\n\n\n\nAbsolute advantage, however, can explain only a very small part of world trade today, such as some of the trade between developed and developing countries. Most of world trade, especially trade among developed countries, could not be explained by absolute advantage."

The ﬁrst nation should specialize in the production and export of the commodity in which its absolute disadvantage is smaller (this is the commodity of its comparative advantage) and import the commodity in which its absolute disadvantage is greater.\nThe statement of the law can be clariﬁed by looking at Table 3.2. The only difference between Tables 3.2 and 3.1 is that the United Kingdom now produces only two units of cloth per hour instead of ﬁve. Thus, the United Kingdom now has an absolute disadvantage in the production of both wheat and cloth with respect to the United States.\nHowever, since U.K. labor is half as productive in cloth but six times less productive in wheat with respect to the United States, the United Kingdom has a comparative advantage in cloth.\nOn the other hand, the United States has an absolute advantage in both wheat and cloth with respect to the United Kingdom, but since its absolute advantage is greater in wheat (6:1) than in cloth (4:2), the United States has a comparative advantage in wheat.\nAccording to the law of comparative advantage, both nations can gain if the United States specializes in the production of wheat and exports some of it in exchange for British cloth. At the same time, the United Kingdom is specializing in the production and exporting of cloth.\n\nTable 3.2: Comparative advantage\n\n\n\n\nUSA\nUK\n\n\n\n\nWheat\n6\n1\n\n\nCloth\n4\n2"

    "text": "The Ricardian model of international trade states that the main reason why countries trade is that diﬀerent countries have diﬀerent productivity (or technologies) for producing diﬀerent goods and services.\nIt shows how countries can gain from exporting goods that they are relatively better at making and importing goods that they are relatively worse at making.\n\n\n\n\nThe Ricardian theory of comparative advantage is based on the idea that if there are technological diﬀerences in the production of goods across countries,\nCountries can gain from trade by exporting goods for which the country has a lower opportunity cost of production and importing goods for which the country’s opportunity costs of production are higher.\nThe model can be understood using a two-country, two-good and one factor of production example.\nSuppose that the two countries are Home(\\(h\\)) and Foreign(\\(f\\)) and the two goods are Bread (\\(b\\)) and Cloth (\\(c\\)).\nThe lone factor of production is labor (\\(L\\)).\nThe production of one unit of each good in each country requires a certain amount of labor which is called the unit labor requirement.\n\nLet’s denote,\n\nThe unit labor requirement in Home by \\(hL_i\\)\nThe unit labor requirement in Foreign by \\(fL_i\\)\nHere \\(i\\) = \\(b\\), \\(c\\)\n\n\\(b\\) denotes Bread and \\(c\\) denotes Cloth\n\n\nTo ﬁx ideas, let us work with the following numbers:\n\n\\(hL_b\\) = 1, \\(hL_c\\) = 2, \\(fL_b\\) = 4 and \\(fL_c\\) = 3"

According to Ricardo, comparative advantage was based on the difference in the productivity of labor among nations, but he provided no explanation for such a difference in productivity, except for possible differences in climate.\nThe Heckscher–Ohlin model of trade states that endowment diﬀerences among countries play a key role in determining the pattern of trade."

    "section": "4.4 The gravity model",
    "text": "4.4 The gravity model\n\nLet’s begin by describing who trades with whom. An empirical relationship known as the gravity model helps to make sense of the value of trade between any pair of countries and sheds light on the impediments that continue to limit international trade even in today’s global economy.\nThree of the top 15 U.S. trading partners are European nations: Germany, the United Kingdom, and France. Why does the United States trade more heavily with these three European countries than with others? The answer is that these are the three largest European economies. That is, they have the highest values of gross domestic product (GDP), which measures the total value of all goods and services produced in an economy.\n\n\nThere is a strong empirical relationship between the size of a country’s economy and the volume of both its imports and its exports.\n\n\nThe basic form of the gravity equation is as follows:\n\n\\[T_{ij} = \\frac{GDP_{i}^{\\alpha } GDP_{j}^{\\beta}}{D_{ij}^{\\theta}}\\] Here,\n\\(T_{ij}\\) indicates bilateral trade between country \\(i\\), and \\(j\\)\n\\(GDP_i\\) indicates the economic size of \\(i\\), measured by gross domestic product\n\\(D_{ij}\\) indicates the bilateral distance between the two countries\nThe parameters are \\(α\\), \\(β\\), and \\(θ\\)"
