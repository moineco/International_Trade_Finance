## What is International economics?

-   International Economics is the study of economic interactions between countries.

-   The world is rapidly globalizing and this is providing many opportunities and major challenges to the nations and people of the world.

-   We will study international economics with a brief overview of the globalization revolution taking place in the world today.

## What is international economics about?

- International economics consists of two main classifications:

   - International trade (Microeconomics)
   - International finance (Macroeconomics)

```{r, echo=FALSE}
Comparision <- c("Economics", "Employment", "Savings", "Trade", "Money")
International_Trade <- c("Microeconomics", "Full employment", "No savings", "Balance", "Real transaction")
International_Finance <- c("Macroeconomics", "Under employment", "Savings", "Imbalance", "Monetary transaction")
df <- data.frame(Comparision, International_Trade, International_Finance)
knitr::kable(df)
```

## Why study international trade?

- Production technologies do not flow easily across borders. There are massive differences in production technologies across countries.

- The use of some technologies is tied to human capital which can not be transferred across countries.

- Government institutions have a huge impact on the effectiveness of different technologies.

## What are the subjects to focus in international trade?

- Seven themes recur throughout the study of international economics: 

   a. The gains from trade
   b. The pattern of trade
   c. Protectionism
   d. The balance of payments
   e. Exchange rate determination
   f. International policy coordination
   g. The international capital market

## What is globalization?

- Increase in international transactions in markets for goods, services, and factors

- Growth and expanded scope of international institutions and
organizations, for instance, UN, World Bank, IMF, WTO

- How can globalization be measured?

  - Trade flows: exports and imports of goods
  - Trade in services: transportation, healthcare, telecommunications, business services
  - Foreign asset ownership
  - Immigration
  - Price convergence: Possibility of trade may have important effects
