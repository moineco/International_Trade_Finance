# Basics of International Economics

## What is International economics?

-   International Economics is the study of economic interactions between countries.

-   The world is rapidly globalizing and this is providing many opportunities and major challenges to the nations and people of the world.

-   We will study international economics with a brief overview of the globalization revolution taking place in the world today.

## What is international economics about?

-   International economics consists of two main classifications:

    -   International trade (Microeconomics)
    -   International finance (Macroeconomics)

```{r, echo=FALSE}
Comparision <- c("Economics", "Employment", "Savings", "Trade", "Money")
International_Trade <- c("Microeconomics", "Full employment", "No savings", "Balance", "Real transaction")
International_Finance <- c("Macroeconomics", "Under employment", "Savings", "Imbalance", "Monetary transaction")
df <- data.frame(Comparision, International_Trade, International_Finance)
knitr::kable(df)
```

## Why study international trade?

-   Production technologies do not flow easily across borders. There are massive differences in production technologies across countries.

-   The use of some technologies is tied to human capital which can not be transferred across countries.

-   Government institutions have a huge impact on the effectiveness of different technologies.

## What are the subjects to focus in international trade?

-   Seven themes recur throughout the study of international economics:

    a.  The gains from trade
    b.  The pattern of trade
    c.  Protectionism
    d.  The balance of payments
    e.  Exchange rate determination
    f.  International policy coordination
    g.  The international capital market

## What is globalization?

-   Increase in international transactions in markets for goods, services, and factors

-   Growth and expanded scope of international institutions and organizations, for instance, UN, World Bank, IMF, WTO

-   How can globalization be measured?

    -   Trade flows: exports and imports of goods
    -   Trade in services: transportation, healthcare, telecommunications, business services
    -   Foreign asset ownership
    -   Immigration
    -   Price convergence: Possibility of trade may have important effects
    

## Globalization and international trade

-   Globalization is the process of interaction and integration among people, companies, and governments worldwide.

-   Globalization has accelerated since the 18th century due to advances in transportation and communications technology.

-   This increase in global interactions has caused a growth in international trade.
