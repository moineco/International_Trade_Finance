# National Income Accounting and the Balance of Payments: Part B

## The Current Account (CA)

- A country’s foreign trade is exactly balanced only rarely. The difference
between exports of goods and services and imports of goods and services is known as
the current account balance (or current account). 

- If we denote the current account by CA, we can express this definition in symbols as:

$$CA = EX - IM$$

- When a country’s imports exceed its exports, we say the country has a *current account deficit*.

- A country has a *current account surplus* when its exports exceed its imports.

- The current account is important because it measures the size and direction of
international borrowing. When a country imports more than it exports, it is buying
more from foreigners than it sells to them and must somehow finance this current
account deficit.

### How does country pay for additional imports once it has spent its export earnings?
