### Human capital matters

-   As a population becomes more literate, numerate, and educated, economic and political institutions evolve to foster long-term economic growth.

-   Rather than geography, Western colonization, and plantation agriculture, the amount of education and other forms of human capital determine the existence or lack of property rights, financial markets, international trade, and other institutions that encourage economic growth.

### Population growth

Population distribution become high due to the following factors:

1.  Type of Land: Flat low land (Ganges Valley in India)

2.  Resources: Resource rich areas (e.g. coal, oil, wood, fishing etc.) tend to densely populated (Western Europe)

3.  Climate: Areas with temperate climates tend to be densely populated (rain and temperature) (Belgium)

4.  Political: Politically stable countries tend to have high populations

5.  Social: Groups of people want to live close to each other for security (e.g. USA). Other groups of people prefer to be isolated (e.g. Scandinavians)

6.  Economic: Job opportunities encourage high population densities, particularly in large cities
