**1. The gains from trade**

- Probably the most important single insight in all of international economics is that there are gains from trade that is, when countries sell goods and services to each other, this exchange is almost always to their mutual benefit.

- Although nations generally gain from international trade, it is quite possible that international trade may hurt particular groups within nations—in other words, that international trade will have strong effects on the distribution of income. 

> Trade can alter the distribution of income between workers and the owners of capital.

**2. The pattern of trade**

- Some aspects of the pattern of trade are easy to understand. Climate and resources clearly explain why Brazil exports coffee and Saudi Arabia exports oil. 

- Why does Japan export automobiles, while the United States exports aircraft?

-  There are various different models that try to explain the reason behind the pattern of trade.

> "Who sells what to whom" have been a major question of international economics.

**3. How much trade?**

- After World War II the advanced democracies, led by the United States, pursued a broad policy of removing barriers to international trade; this policy reflected the view that free trade was a force not only for prosperity but also for promoting world peace.

- In 2016, Britain shocked the political establishment by voting to leave the European Union, which guarantees free movement of goods and people among its members.

> Conflicts of interest within nations are usually more important in determining trade policy than conflicts of interest between nations. 

**4. Balance of payments**

- The balance of payments (BOP) tracks international transactions. When funds go into a country, a credit is added to the balance of payments (“BOP”). When funds leave a country, a deduction is made.

- The balance of payments includes both the current account and capital/financial account.
    
    - The current account (CA) includes a nation's net trade in goods and services, its net earnings on cross-border investments, and its net transfer payments.
    
    - The capital/financial account (FA) consists of a nation's transactions in financial instruments and central bank reserves.
    
    - The sum of all transactions recorded in the balance of payments should be zero; however, exchange rate fluctuations and differences in accounting practices may hinder this in practice.
    
> The BOP has become a central issue for the United States because the nation has run huge trade deficits every year since 1982.
