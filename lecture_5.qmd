# The Instruments of Trade Policy

## Heckscher--Ohlin model of trade

-   We now go one step further and explain the reason, or cause, for the difference in relative commodity prices and comparative advantage between the two nations.

-   questions were left largely unanswered by Ricardo. According to Ricardo, comparative advantage was based on the difference in the productivity of labor among nations, but he provided no explanation for such a difference in productivity, except for possible differences in climate.

-   The Heckscher--Ohlin model of trade states that endowment diﬀerences among countries play a key role in determining the pattern of trade.

## The Krugman model of trade

-   The Krugman model or the model of trade based on internal economies of scale in production.

-   It shows how countries can gain from trade even in a world where countries have identical endowments and technologies, provided that production functions exhibit increasing returns to scale and consumers have a love for variety.

## The gravity model

-   Let's begin by describing who trades with whom. An empirical relationship known as the gravity model helps to make sense of the value of trade between any pair of countries and sheds light on the impediments that continue to limit international trade even in today's global economy.

-   Three of the top 15 U.S. trading partners are European nations: Germany, the United Kingdom, and France. Why does the United States trade more heavily with these three European countries than with others? The answer is that these are the three largest European economies. That is, they have the highest values of gross domestic product (GDP), which measures the total value of all goods and services produced in an economy.

> There is a strong empirical relationship between the size of a country's economy and the volume of both its imports and its exports.

-   The basic form of the gravity equation is as follows:

$$T_{ij} = \frac{GDP_{i}^{\alpha } GDP_{j}^{\beta}}{D_{ij}^{\theta}}$$ Here,

$T_{ij}$ indicates bilateral trade between country $i$, and $j$

$GDP_i$ indicates the economic size of $i$, measured by gross domestic product

$D_{ij}$ indicates the bilateral distance between the two countries

The parameters are $α$, $β$, and $θ$
