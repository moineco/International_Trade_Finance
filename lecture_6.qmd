# The Political Economy of Trade Policy

Previous lectures have answered the question, “Why do nations trade?” by
describing the causes and effects of international trade and the functioning of
a trading world economy. This chapter examines the policies that governments adopt toward international
trade, policies that involve a number of different actions. These actions include:

- Taxes 

- Subsidies 

- Legal limits on the value or volume of particular imports

- Other measures

The chapter thus provides a framework for understanding the effects of the most
important instruments of trade policy.


## Basic Tariff Analysis

A tariff is a tax levied when a good is imported. There are various types of tariff. 

- *Specific tariff* are levied as a fixed charge for each unit of goods imported (for example, $3 per barrel of oil).

- *Ad valorem* tariffs are taxes that are levied as a fraction of the value of
the imported goods (for example, a 25 percent U.S. tariff on imported trucks).
